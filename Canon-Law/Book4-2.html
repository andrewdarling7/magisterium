  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. A vow is personal if the person making the vow promises an action; real if the person making the vow promises some thing; mixed if it shares the nature of a personal and a real vow.</p>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1194 A vow ceases by the lapse of the time designated to fulfill the obligation, by a substantial change of the matter promised, by the absence of a condition on which the vow depends, by the absence of the purpose of the vow, by dispensation, or by commutation.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1195 The person who has power over the matter of the vow can suspend the obligation of the vow for as long a time as the fulfillment of the vow brings disadvantage to that person.</p>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1200<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A person who freely swears to do something is bound by a special obligation of religion to fulfill what he or she aYrmed by oath.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. An oath extorted by malice, force, or grave fear is null by the law itself.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1201<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A promissory oath follows the nature and conditions of the act to which it is attached.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. If an oath is added to an act which directly tends toward the harm of others or toward the disadvantage of the public good or of eternal salvation, then the act is not reinforced by the oath.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1202 The obligation arising from a promissory oath ceases:</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">1/</span> if it is remitted by the person for whose benefit the oath was made;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">2/</span> if the matter sworn to is substantially changed or if, after the circumstances have changed, it becomes either evil or entirely indif-ferent or, finally, impedes a greater good;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">3/</span> if the purpose or a condition under which the oath may have been taken ceases;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">4/</span> by dispensation or commutation, according to the norm of can. 1203.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1203 Those who can suspend, dispense, or commute a vow have the same power in the same manner over a promissory oath; but if the dispensation from the oath tends to the disadvantage of others who refuse to remit the obligation of the oath, only the Apostolic See can dispense the oath.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1204 An oath must be interpreted strictly according to the law and according to the intention of the person taking the oath or, if that person acts out of malice, according to the intention of the person to whom the oath is made.</p>
