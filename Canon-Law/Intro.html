  </h2>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>
    During the course of the centuries, the Catholic Church has been
    accustomed to reform and renew the laws of canonical discipline so
    that, in constant fidelity to her divine Founder, they may be better
    adapted to the saving mission entrusted to her. Prompted by this
    same purpose and fulfilling at last the expectations of the whole
    Catholic world, I order today, January 25, 1983, the promulgation of
    the revised Code of Canon Law. In so doing, my thoughts go back to
    the same day of the year 1959, when my Predecessor of happy memory,
    John XXIII, announced for the first time his decision to reform the
    existing corpus of canonical legislation which had been promulgate
    on the feast of Pentecost in the year 1917.
  </p>
  <p>
    Such a decision to reform the Code was taken together with two other
    decisions of which the Pontiff spoke on that same day, and they
    concerned the intention to hold a Synod of the Diocese of Rome and
    to convoke the Ecumenical Council. Of these two events, the first
    was not closely connected with the reform of the Code, but the
    second, that is, the Council, is of supreme importance in regard to
    the present matter and is closely connected with it.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we ask ourselves why John XXIII considered it necessary to reform
    the existing Code, the answer can perhaps be found in the Code
    itself which was promulgated in the year 1917. But there exists also
    another answer and that is the decisive one, namely, that the reform
    of the Code of Canon Law appeared to be definitely desired and
    requested by the same Council which devoted such great attention to
    the Church.
  </p>
  <p>
    As is obvious, when the revision of the Code was first announced,
    the Council was an event of the future. Moreover, the acts of its
    magisterium and especially its doctrine on the Church would be
    decided in the years 1962-1965; however, it is clear to everyone
    that&nbsp;John&nbsp;XXIII's intuition was very true, and with good
    reason it must be said that his decision was for the good of the
    Church in the long term.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, the new Code, which is promulgated today, necessarily
    required the previous work of the Council; and although it was
    announced together with the Ecumenical Council, nevertheless it
    follows it chronologically, because the work undertaken in its
    preparation, since it had to be based upon the Council, could not
    begin until after completion of the latter.
  </p>
  <p>
    Turning our mind today to the beginning of this long journey, that
    is, to that January 25, 1959, and to&nbsp;John&nbsp;XXIII himself
    who initiated the revision of the Code, I must recognize that this
    Code derives from one and the same intention, which is that of the
    renewal of the Christian life. From such an intention, in fact, the
    entire work of the Council drew its norms and its direction.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we now pass on to consider the nature of the work which preceded
    the promulgation of the Code, and also the manner in which it was
    carried out, especially during the Pontificates of&nbsp;Paul&nbsp;VI
    and of&nbsp;John Paul&nbsp;I, and from then until the present day,
    it must be clearly pointed out that this work was brought to
    completion in an outstandingly collegial spirit; and this not only
    in regard to the material drafting of the work, but also as regards
    the very substance of the laws enacted.
  </p>
  <p>
    This note of collegiality, which eminently characterizes and
    distinguishes the process of origin of the present Code, corresponds
    perfectly with the teaching and the character of the Second Vatican
    Council. Therefore the Code, not only because of its content but
    also because of its very origin, manifests the spirit of this
    Council, in the documents of which the Church, the universal
    "sacrament of salvation" (cf. Dogmatic Constitution on the
    Church,&nbsp;Lumen gentium, nos. 1, 9, 48), is presented as the
    People of God and its hierarchical constitution appears based on the
    College of Bishops united with its Head.
  </p>
  <p>
    For this reason, therefore, the bishops and the episcopates were
    invited to collaborate in the preparation of the new Code, so that
    by means of such a long process, by a method as far as possible
    collegial, there should gradually mature the juridical formulas
    which would later serve for the use of the entire Church. In all
    these phases of the work there also took part experts, namely,
    specialists in theology, history, and especially in canon law, who
    were chosen from all over the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    To one and all of them I wish to express today my sentiments of deep
    gratitude.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the first place there come before my eyes the figures of the
    deceased Cardinals who presided over the preparatory commission:
    Cardinal Pietro Ciriaci who began the work, and Cardinal Pericle
    Felici who, for many years, guided the course of the work almost to
    its end. I think then of the secretaries of the same commission:
    Very Rev. Mons. Giacomo Violardo, later Cardinal, and Father
    Raimondo Bidagor, S.J., both of whom in carrying out this task
    poured out the treasures of their doctrine and wisdom. Together with
    them I recall the Cardinals, the archbishops, the bishops and all
    those who were members of that commission, as well as the consultors
    of the individual study groups engaged during these years in such a
    difficult work, and whom God in the meantime has called to their
    eternal reward. I pray to God for all of them.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am pleased to remember also the living, beginning with the present
    Pro - President of the commission, the revered brother, Most Rev.
    Rosal√≠o Castillo Lara, who for a very long time has done excellent
    work in a task of such great responsibility, to pass then to our
    beloved son, Mons. Willy Onclin, whose devotion and diligence have
    greatly contributed to the happy outcome of the work, and finally to
    all the others in the commission itself, whether as Cardinal members
    or as officials, consultors and collaborators in the various study
    groups, or in other offices, who have given their appreciated
    contribution to the drafting and the completion of such a weighty
    and complex work.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, in promulgating the Code today, I am fully aware that
    this act is an expression of pontifical authority and, therefore, it
    is invested with a "primatial" character. But I am also aware that
    this Code in its objective content reflects the collegial care of
    all my brothers in the episcopate for the Church. Indeed, by a
    certain analogy with the Council, it should be considered as the
    fruit of a collegial collaboration because of the united efforts on
    the part of specialized persons and institutions throughout the
    whole Church.
  </p>
  <p>
    A second question arises concerning the very nature of the Code of
    Canon Law. To reply adequately to this question, one must mentally
    recall the distant patrimony of law contained in the books of the
    Old and New Testament from which is derived, as from its first
    source, the whole juridical - legislative tradition of the Church.
  </p>
  <p>
    Christ the Lord, indeed, did not in the least wish to destroy the
    very rich heritage of the Law and of the Prophets which was
    gradually formed from the history and experience of the People of
    God in the Old Testament, but He brought it to completion (cf. Mt.
    5:17), in such wise that in a new and higher way it became part of
    the heritage of the New Testament. Therefore, although St.Paul, in
    expounding the Paschal Mystery, teaches that justification is not
    obtained by the works of the Law, but by means of faith (cf. Rom.
    3:28; Gal. 2:16), he does not thereby exclude the binding force of
    the Decalogue (cf. Rom. 13:28; Gal. 5:13-25; 6:2), nor does he deny
    the importance of discipline in the Church of God (cf. 1 Cor.
    chapters 5, 6). Thus the writings of the New Testament enable us to
    understand still more the importance itself of discipline and make
    us see better how it is more closely connected with the saving
    character of the evangelical message itself.
  </p>
  <p>
    This being so, it appears sufficiently clear that the Code is in no
    way intended as a substitute for faith, grace and the charisms in
    the life of the Church and of the faithful. On the contrary, its
    purpose is rather to create such an order in the ecclesial society
    that, while assigning the primacy to faith, grace and the charisms,
    it at the same time renders easier their organic development in the
    life both of the ecclesial society and of the individual persons who
    belong to it.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Code, as the principal legislative document of the Church,
    founded on the juridical - legislative heritage of Revelation and
    Tradition, is to be regarded as an indispensable instrument to
    ensure order both in individual and social life, and also in the
    Church's activity itself. Therefore, besides containing the
    fundamental elements of the hierarchical and organic structure of
    the Church as willed by her divine Founder, or as based upon
    apostolic, or in any case most ancient, tradition, and besides the
    fundamental principles which govern the exercise of the threefold
    office entrusted to the Church itself, the Code must also lay down
    certain rules and norms of behavior.
  </p>
  <p>
    The instrument, which the Code is, fully corresponds to the nature
    of the Church, especially as it is proposed by the teaching of the
    Second Vatican Council in general, and in a particular way by its
    ecclesiological teaching. Indeed, in a certain sense, this new Code
    could be understood as a great effort to translate this same
    doctrine, that is, the conciliar ecclesiology, into canonical
    language. If, however, it is impossible to translate perfectly into
    canonical language the conciliar image of the Church, nevertheless,
    in this image there should always be found as far as possible its
    essential point of reference.
  </p>
  <p>
    From this there are derived certain fundamental criteria which
    should govern the entire new Code, both in the sphere of its
    specific matter and also in the language connected with it. It could
    indeed be said that from this there is derived that character of
    complementarily which the Code presents in relation to the teaching
    of the Second Vatican Council, with particular reference to the two
    constitutions, the Dogmatic Constitution&nbsp;Lumen gentium&nbsp;and
    the Pastoral Constitution&nbsp;Gaudium et spes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hence it follows that what constitutes the substantial "novelty" of
    the Second Vatican Council, in line with the legislative tradition
    of the Church, especially in regard to ecclesiology, constitutes
    likewise the "novelty" of the new Code.
  </p>
  <p>
    Among the elements which characterize the true and genuine image of
    the Church, we should emphasize especially the following: the
    doctrine in which the Church is presented as the People of God
    (cf.&nbsp;Lumen gentium, no. 2), and authority as a service (cf.
    ibid., no. 3); the doctrine in which the Church is seen as a
    "communion," and which, therefore, determines the relations which
    should exist between the particular Churches and the universal
    Church, and between collegiality and the primacy; the doctrine,
    moreover, according to which all the members of the People of God,
    in the way suited to each of them, participate in the threefold
    office of Christ: priestly, prophetic and kingly. With this teaching
    there is also linked that which concerns the duties and rights of
    the faithful, and particularly of the laity; and finally, the
    Church's commitment to ecumenism.
  </p>
  <p>
    If, therefore, the Second Vatican Council has drawn from the
    treasury of Tradition elements both old and new, and the new
    consists precisely in the elements which we have enumerated, then it
    is clear that the Code also should reflect the same note of fidelity
    in newness and of newness in fidelity, and conform itself to that in
    its own field and in its particular way of expressing itself.
  </p>
  <p>
    The new Code of Canon Law appears at a moment when the bishops of
    the whole Church not only ask for its promulgation, but are crying
    out for it insistently and almost with impatience.
  </p>
  <p>
    In actual fact the Code of Canon Law is extremely necessary for the
    Church. Since, indeed, it is organized as a social and visible
    structure, it must also have norms: in order that its hierarchical
    and organic structure be visible; in order that the exercise of the
    functions divinely entrusted to her, especially that of sacred power
    and of the administration of the sacraments, may be adequately
    organized; in order that the mutual relations of the faithful may be
    regulated according to justice based upon charity, with the rights
    of individuals guaranteed and well defined; in order, finally, that
    common initiatives, undertaken for a Christian life ever more
    perfect may be sustained, strengthened and fostered by canonical
    norms.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, the canonical laws by their very nature must be observed.
    The greatest care has therefore been taken to ensure that in the
    lengthy preparation of the Code the wording of the norms should be
    accurate, and that they should be based on a solid juridical,
    canonical and theological foundation.
  </p>
  <p>
    After all these considerations it is to be hoped that the new
    canonical legislation will prove to be an efficacious means in order
    that the Church may progress in conformity with the spirit of the
    Second Vatican Council, and may every day be ever more suited to
    carry out its office of salvation in this world.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am pleased to entrust to all with a confident spirit these
    considerations of mine in the moment in which I promulgate this
    fundamental body of ecclesiastical laws for the Latin Church.
  </p>
  <p>
    May God grant that joy and peace with justice and obedience obtain
    favor for this Code, and that what has been ordered by the Head be
    observed by the members.
  </p>
  <p>
    Trusting therefore in the help of divine grace, sustained by the
    authority of the holy Apostles Peter and&nbsp;Paul, with certain
    knowledge, and in response to the wishes of the bishops of the whole
    world who have collaborated with me in a collegial spirit; with the
    supreme authority with which I am vested, by means of this
    Constitution, to be valid forever in the future, I promulgate the
    present Code as it has been set in order and revised. I command that
    for the future it is to have the force of law for the whole Latin
    Church, and I entrust it to the watchful care of all those
    concerned, in order that it may be observed.
  </p>
  <p>
    So that all may more easily be informed and have a thorough
    knowledge of these norms before they have juridical binding force, I
    declare and order that they will have the force of law beginning
    from the first day of Advent of this year, 1983.
  </p>
  <p>
    And this notwithstanding any contrary ordinances, constitutions,
    privileges (even worthy of special or individual mention) or
    customs.
  </p>
  <p>
    I therefore exhort all the faithful to observe the proposed
    legislation with a sincere spirit and good will in the hope that
    there may flower again in the Church a renewed discipline; and that
    consequently the salvation of souls may be rendered ever easier
    under the protection of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of the
    Church.

  <p>PREFACE TO THE LATIN EDITION</p>
  <p>
    From the time of the primitive Church it has been customary to
    collect the sacred canons into one book to facilitate a knowledge of
    them as well as their use and observance especially by sacred
    ministers, since ‚Äúno priest is permitted to be ignorant of the
    sacred canons‚Äù as Pope Celestine warned in a letter to the bishops
    of Apulia and Calabria (July 21, 429: cf. Jaffe,2 n. 371; Mansi IV,
    col. 469). His words are echoed by the Fourth Council of Toledo
    (633), which prescribed the following after the restoration of
    ecclesiastical discipline in the kingdom of the Visigoths once the
    Church had been freed from Arianism:
  </p>
  <p>
    ‚ÄúPriests are to know the sacred scripture and the canons‚Äù because
    ‚Äúignorance, the mother of all errors, is especially to be avoided by
    priests of God‚Äù (can. 25: Mansi X, col. 627).
  </p>
  <p>
    In fact during the first ten centuries nearly everywhere there
    flourished countless collections of ecclesiastical laws. These
    private collections contained norms issued especially by the
    councils and the Roman Pontiffs as well as other norms taken from
    lesser sources. In the middle of the twelfth century, this mass of
    collections and norms, not infrequently contradicting one another,
    was put in order again through the private initiative of the monk
    Gratian. This concordance of laws and collections, later called the
    Decretum Gratiani, constituted the first part of that significant
    collection of laws of the Church which, in imitation of the Corpus
    Iuris Civilis of the Emperor Justinian, was called the Corpus Iuris
    Canonici and contained the laws which had been passed during two
    centuries by the supreme authority of the Roman pontiffs with the
    assistance of experts in canon law called glossators. Besides the
    Decree of Gratian, in which the earlier norms were contained, the
    Corpus consists of the Liber Extra of Gregory IX, the Liber Sextus
    of Boniface VIII, the Clementinae, i.e. the collection of Clement V
    promulgated by John XXII, to which are added the Extravagantes of
    this pope and the Extravagantes communes, decretals of various Roman
    pontiffs never gathered in an authentic collection. The
    ecclesiastical law which this Corpus embraces constitutes the
    classical law of the Catholic Church and is commonly called by this
    name.
  </p>
  <p>
    To this corpus of law of the Latin Church corresponds to some extent
    the Syntagma canonum or oriental corpus of canons of the Greek
    Church.
  </p>
  <p>
    Subsequent laws, especially those enacted by the Council of Trent
    during the time of the Catholic Reformation and those issued later
    by various dicasteries of the Roman Curia, were never digested into
    one collection. This was the reason why during the course of time
    legislation outside the Corpus Iuris Canonici constituted ‚Äúan
    immense pile of laws piled on top of other laws.‚Äù The lack of a
    systematic arrangement of the laws and the lack of legal certainty
    along with the obsolescence of and lacunae in many laws led to a
    situation where church discipline was increasingly imperiled and
    jeopardized.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore during the preparatory period prior to the First Vatican
    Council, many bishops asked that a new and sole collection laws be
    prepared to expedite the pastoral care of the people of God in a
    more certain and secure fashion.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although this task could not be implemented through conciliar
    action, the Apostolic See subsequently addressed certain more urgent
    disciplinary issues through a new organization of laws. Finally,
    Pope Pius X, at the very beginning of his pontificate, undertook
    this task when he proposed to collect and reform all ecclesiastical
    laws and determined that the enterprise be carried out under the
    leadership of Cardinal Pietro Gasparri.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first issue to be resolved in such a significant and difficult
    undertaking was the internal and external form of the new
    collection. It was decided to forego the method of compilations of
    laws whereby individual laws would have been expressed in the
    extensiveness of the original text; rather the modern method of
    codification was chosen. Hence texts containing and proposing a
    precept were expressed in a new and briefer form. However, all of
    the material was organized in five books which substantially
    imitated the system of Roman law institutes on persons, things and
    actions. The work took twelve years with the collaboration of
    experts, consultors and bishops throughout the Church. The character
    of the new Code was clearly enuntiated in the beginning of canon 6:
    ‚ÄúThe Code generally retains the existing discipline although it
    introduces appropriate changes.‚Äù
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore it was not a case of enacting a new law but rather a
    matter of arranging in a new fashion the operative legislation at
    that time. After the death of Pius X, this universal, exclusive, and
    authentic collection was promulgated on May 27, 1917 by his
    successor Benedict XV; it took effect on May 19, 1918.
  </p>
  <p>
    Everyone hailed the universal law of this Pio-Benedictine Code,
    which made a significant contribution to the effective promotion of
    pastoral ministry throughout the Church, which in the meantime was
    experiencing new growth. Nevertheless, both the external situation
    of the Church in a world which had experienced sweeping changes and
    significant shifts in customs within a few decades as well as
    progressive internal factors within the ecclesiastical community
    necessarily brought it about that a new reform of canon law was
    increasingly more imperative and was requested. The Supreme Pontiff
    John XXIII clearly recognized the signs of the times, for when he
    first announced the Roman Synod and the Second Vatican Council, he
    also announced that these events would be a necessary preparation
    for undertaking the desired renewal of the Code.
  </p>
  <p>
    Shortly after the Ecumenical Council had begun, the Commission for
    the Revision of the Code of Canon Law was established on March 28,
    1963 with Cardinal Pietro Ciriaci as president and Monsignor Giacomo
    Violardo as secretary. However, the cardinal members of the
    Commission in a meeting with the president on November 12 of that
    same year agreed that the true and proper efforts of the Commission
    should be deferred and should commence only at the conclusion of the
    Council. The reform was to be carried out according to the decisions
    and principles to be determined by that same Council. Meanwhile on
    April 17, 1964 Paul VI added seventy consultors to the Commission
    established by his predecessor John XXIII; he subsequently named
    other cardinal members and consultors from all over the world to
    participate in the expediting of the project. On February 24, 1965
    the Supreme Pontiff named Rev. Raimondo Bidagor, S.J. the new
    secretary of the Commission since Monsignor Violardo had been
    promoted to the office of secretary of the Congregation for the
    Discipline of the Sacraments; on November 17 of the same year the
    pope appointed Monsignor fiilliam Onclin as adjunct secretary of the
    Commission. After the death of Cardinal Ciriaci, Archbishop Pericle
    Felici, former general secretary of Vatican Council II, was named
    pro-president on February 21, 1967. On June 26 of that same year he
    became a member of the Sacred College of Cardinals and subsequently
    assumed the office of president of the Commission. Since Father
    Bidagor ceased functioning as secretary of the Commission on
    November 1, 1973 on the occasion of his eightieth birthday, Most
    Reverend Rosalio Castillo Lara, S.D.B., titular bishop of Praecausa
    and coadjutor bishop of Trujillo, Venezuela, was named the new
    secretary of the Commission. On May 17, 1982 he was appointed
    pro-president of the Commission upon the premature death of Cardinal
    Felici.
  </p>
  <p>
    On November 20, 1965, just before the closing of the Second Vatican
    Council, there was a solemn session of the Commission in the
    presence of the Supreme Pontiff Paul VI, at which were present the
    cardinal members of the Commission, the secretaries, consultors and
    officials of the Secretariat appointed in the meantime.
  </p>
  <p>
    This session publicly inaugurated the work of the Code Commission.
    The allocution of the Supreme Pontiff laid the foundations of the
    whole enterprise to a certain extent. It was recalled that canon law
    flows from the nature of the Church, that it is rooted in the power
    of jurisdiction entrusted to the Church by Christ, and that its
    purpose is to be viewed in terms of the care of souls in view of
    external salvation. Furthermore, the character of church law was
    illustrated; its necessity was vindicated against the more common
    objections; the history of the progress of law and its collections
    was alluded to; and especially there was highlighted the urgent need
    of a new reform of the law to respond to the ongoing need of
    appropriately adapting church discipline to changing circumstances.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Supreme Pontiff further indicated to the Commission two elements
    which should underly the whole revision effort. First of all it was
    not simply a matter of a new organization of the laws as had
    occurred at the time of the Pio-
  </p>
  <p>
    Benedictine Code; but rather it was also and especially a matter of
    reforming the norms to accommodate them to a new mentality and new
    needs even if the old law was to supply the foundation for the work
    of revision. Careful attention was to be paid to all the decrees and
    acts of the Second Vatican Council since they contain the main lines
    of legislative renewal either because norms were issued which
    directly affected new institutes and ecclesiastical discipline, or
    because it was necessary that the doctrinal riches of the Council,
    which contributed so much to pastoral life, have their consequences
    and necessary impact on canonical legislation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Repeatedly in allocutions, precepts and decisions during the
    following years, the two above mentioned elements were recalled to
    the minds of the Commission members by the Supreme Pontiff, who
    continued to oversee the whole enterprise from on high and
    assiduously pursue it.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the subcommissions or study groups were to carry on their work in
    a methodical fashion, it was necessary above all that there be
    identified and approved certain principles which would serve as
    guidelines during the process of revising the whole Code. The
    central committee of consultors prepared the text of a document,
    which, at the request of the Supreme Pontiff, was submitted to the
    examination of a general session of the synod of bishops in October
    1967. The following principles were approved nearly unanimously.
  </p>
  <p>
    1. In renewing the law the juridic character of the new Code, which
    the social nature of the Church requires, is to be retained.
    Therefore the Code is to furnish norms so that the members of the
    Christian faithful in living the Christian life may share in the
    goods offered by the Church to lead them to eternal salvation.
    Hence, in view of this end, the Code must define and protect the
    rights and obligations of each person towards others and towards the
    ecclesiastical society to the extent that these rights and
    obligations pertain to divine worship and the salvation of souls.
  </p>
  <p>
    2. There is to be a coordination between the external forum and the
    internal forum, which is proper to the Church and has been operative
    for centuries, so as to preclude any conflict between the two.
  </p>
  <p>
    3. To foster the pastoral care of souls as much as possible, the new
    law, besides the virtue of justice, is to take cognizance of
    charity, temperance, humaneness and moderation, whereby equity is to
    be pursued not only in the application of the laws by pastors of
    souls but also in the legislation itself.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hence unduly rigid norms are to be set aside and rather recourse is
    to be taken to exhortations and persuasions where there is no need
    of a strict observance of the law on account of the public good and
    general ecclesiastical discipline.
  </p>
  <p>
    4. In order that the Supreme Legislator and the bishops may
    collaborate in the care of souls and may exercise the pastoral
    office in a more positive fashion, those faculties to dispense from
    general laws which until now have been extraordinary are to become
    ordinary with reservations to the supreme power of the universal
    Church or other higher authorities only in those areas which require
    an exception on account of the common good.
  </p>
  <p>
    5. Careful attention is to be given to the greater application of
    the so-called principle of subsidiarity within the Church. It is a
    principle which is rooted in a higher one because the office of
    bishops with its attached powers is a reality of divine law. In
    virtue of this principle one may defend the appropriateness and even
    the necessity of providing for the welfare especially of individual
    institutes through particular laws and the recognition of a healthy
    autonomy for particular executive power while legislative unity and
    universal and general law are observed. On the basis of the same
    principle, the new Code entrusts either to particular laws or to
    executive power whatever is not necessary for the unity of the
    discipline of the universal Church so that appropriate provision is
    made for a healthy ‚Äúdecentralization‚Äù while avoiding the danger of
    division into or the establishment of national churches.
  </p>
  <p>
    6. On account of the fundamental equality of all members of the
    Christian faithful and the diversity of offices and functions rooted
    in the hierarchical order of the Church, it is expedient that the
    rights of persons be appropriately defined and safeguarded. This
    brings it about that the exercise of authority appears more clearly
    as service, that its use is more clearly reinforced, and that abuses
    are removed.
  </p>
  <p>
    7. In order that such objectives may be appropriately implemented,
    it is necessary that particular attention be given to the
    organization of a procedure which envisions the protection of
    subjective rights. Therefore in renewing the law attention should be
    paid to those elements which are most especially lacking in this
    area, i.e. administrative recourses and the administration of
    justice.
  </p>
  <p>
    To achieve this it is necessary that the various functions of
    ecclesiastical power be clearly distinguished, i.e. the legislative,
    administrative, and judicial functions. What individual functions
    are to be exercised by which governmental organs is also to be
    defined.
  </p>
  <p>
    8. The principle of territoriality in the exercise of ecclesiastical
    government is to be revised somewhat, for contemporary apostolic
    factors seem to recommend personal jurisdictional units. Therefore
    the new Code is to affirm the following principle: generally
    speaking the portions of the people of God to be governed are to be
    determined territorially; however, if it is advantageous, other
    factors can be admitted as criteria for determining a community of
    the faithful, at least along with territoriality.
  </p>
  <p>
    9. As an external, visible and independent society, the Church
    cannot renounce penal law. However, penalties are generally to be
    ferendae sententiae and are to be inflicted and remitted only in the
    external forum. Latae sententiae penalties are to be reduced to a
    few cases and are to be inflicted only for the most serious
    offenses.
  </p>
  <p>
    10. Finally, as is admitted by all, the new systematic arrangement
    of the Code required by the revision process can only be sketched at
    the outset but cannot be de-fined and determined precisely.
    Therefore the new organization of the Code will have to be pursued
    only after a sufficient revision of its individual parts, in fact
    only after nearly the whole work has been completed.
  </p>
  <p>
    From these principles which ought to guide the process of revising
    the Code, it is quite clear that there is a need to apply everywhere
    the doctrine of the Church expressed by the Second Vatican Council,
    especially its determination that attention is to be paid not only
    to the external social dimensions of the Mystical Body of Christ but
    also and especially to its internal life.
  </p>
  <p>
    And in point of fact the consultors were guided by these principles
    in drafting the new text of the Code.
  </p>
  <p>
    Meanwhile a January 15, 1966 letter of the cardinal president of the
    Commission to the presidents of the conferences of bishops asked the
    bishops of the whole Catholic world to express their concerns and
    advice regarding the law to be drafted and the best way of
    structuring relationships between the conferences of bishops and the
    Commission so as to maximize their cooperation for the good of the
    Church. Furthermore, the bishops were also asked to send to the
    Secretariat of the Commission the names of canonical experts in
    their respective regions who in the judgment of the bishops were the
    most distinguished in terms of canonical expertise; the special
    competence of these experts was also to be indicated. The consultors
    and their collaborators could be selected and named from these
    individuals. Actually, at the very beginning and throughout the
    working of the Commission, besides its cardinal members the
    following collaborated in the drafting of the new Code of Canon Law:
    bishops, priests, religious, laity, experts in canon law, theology,
    pastoral practice, and civil law from all over the Catholic world.
    During the whole revision process 105 cardinals, 77 archbishops and
    bishops, 73 secular presbyters, 47 religious presbyters, 3 religious
    women and 12 lay persons from 5 continents and 31 countries served
    as members, consultors and other types of collaborators with the
    Commission.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even before the last session of the Second Vatican Council, the
    consultors of the Commission were gathered in a private session on
    May 6, 1965, in which, with the consent of the Holy Father, the
    Commission president submitted three fundamental questions for their
    study. It was asked first whether one or two codes, i.e. Latin and
    Oriental, were to be drafted; it was also asked what methodology was
    to be followed in the drafting process or how the Commission and its
    organs were to proceed; finally, it was asked what would be an
    appropriate division of labor among the various subcommissions,
    which would be functioning simultaneously. Reports prepared by three
    groups established to deal with these questions were forwarded to
    all the Commission members.
  </p>
  <p>
    The cardinal members of the Commission met for the second time on
    November 25, 1965 to discuss these same questions and respond to
    certain proposals (dubia) formulated concerning them.
  </p>
  <p>
    A principle regarding the systematic organization of the new Code to
    be proposed to the synod of bishops was drawn up from a votum of the
    central committee of consultors, which had met on April 3-7, 1967.
    After the meeting of the synod, it was deemed appropriate to
    establish in November, 1967 a special committee of consultors to
    study the systematic organization of the Code. At a meeting of this
    committee at the beginning of April, 1968, all agreed on not
    incorporating in the Code properly liturgical laws, norms on
    beatification and canonization processes, and norms on the external
    relations of the Church. All agreed as well that in the part on the
    people of God there would be placed norms on the juridic status of
    all members of the Christian faithful and a distinct treatment of
    the powers and faculties which pertain to the exercise of the
    different functions and offices. Finally all agreed that the
    structure of the books of the Pio-Benedictine Code could not be
    maintained in its integrity.
  </p>
  <p>
    During the third meeting of the cardinal members of the Commission
    on May 28, 1968, they substantially approved a temporary arrangement
    according to which the study groups already established were
    organized in a new way: ‚Äúthe systematic organization of the Code,‚Äù
    ‚Äúgeneral norms,‚Äù ‚Äúthe sacred hierarchy,‚Äù ‚Äúinstitutes of perfection,‚Äù
    ‚Äúlaity,‚Äù ‚Äúphysical and moral persons in general,‚Äù ‚Äúmarriage,‚Äù
    ‚Äúsacraments other than marriage,‚Äù ‚Äúthe ecclesiastical magisterium,‚Äù
    ‚Äúthe patrimonial law of the Church,‚Äù ‚Äúprocesses,‚Äù ‚Äúpenal law.‚Äù
  </p>
  <p>
    The issues dealt with by the study group on ‚Äúphysical and juridic
    persons‚Äù (it was subsequently called this) were later incorporated
    in the book on ‚Äúgeneral norms.‚Äù Furthermore it was deemed
    appropriate to establish a study group on ‚Äúsacred places and times
    and divine worship.‚Äù In view of their broader competence, the names
    of some other study groups were changed: the group on ‚Äúthe laity‚Äù
    was later called the group on ‚Äúthe rights and associations of the
    faithful and the laity‚Äù; the group on ‚Äúreligious‚Äù was later called
    the group on ‚Äúinstitutes of perfection‚Äù and finally the group on
    ‚Äúinstitutes of life consecrated through the profession of the
    evangelical counsels.‚Äù
  </p>
  <p>
    The principal features of the method followed during the more than
    sixteen year revision process are to be briefly recalled. The
    consultors of the individual groups fulfilled their significant
    duties with the greatest dedication, considering only the good of
    the Church either in preparing written observations on the parts of
    their own schemata, or in discussing various issues at meetings in
    Rome at determined times, or in examining the animadversions,
    observations and opinions on their schemata which were forwarded to
    the Commission. The procedure was as follows. To each of the
    consultors, who numbered from eight to fourteen on the individual
    study groups, was assigned a certain issue which was to be studied
    in view of the revision process, with the present Code as the point
    of departure.
  </p>
  <p>
    After an examination of the questions, each consultor was to
    transmit a written opinion to the Secretariat of the Commission as
    well as a copy to the relator and, if time permitted, to all the
    members of the study group. The consultors of the study group met in
    Rome according to a predetermined schedule. With the relator leading
    the discussions, all the questions and opinions were considered
    until a text of canons was approved, at times after a process of
    voting on individual parts, and drafted in schema form. During the
    session the relator was aided by an official who functioned as an
    actuary.
  </p>
  <p>
    The number of meetings for each study group was greater or lesser
    depending on the concrete issues, and the work was carried on for
    years.
  </p>
  <p>
    Especially during the latter stages of the process, certain mixed
    study groups were established so that consultors from different
    groups could meet and discuss issues which directly pertained to
    several groups and had to be resolved through common counsel.
  </p>
  <p>
    After the drafting of some schemata was completed by the study
    groups, the Supreme Legislator was asked to give some concrete
    indications of the subsequent steps to be taken in continuing the
    work. According to the norms handed down at the time, those steps
    were as follows.
  </p>
  <p>
    The schemata together with an explanatory report were sent to the
    Supreme Pontiff, who determined whether they were to be forwarded
    for consultation purposes. After this permission was obtained, the
    printed schemata were submitted to the examination of the universal
    episcopate and other consultative organs (namely, the dicasteries of
    the Roman Curia, ecclesiastical universities and faculties, and the
    Union of Superiors General) in order that they might express their
    opinion within a prudently determined time frame‚Äînot less than six
    months.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the same time, the schemata were also forwarded to the cardinal
    members of the Commission so as to enable them to make their general
    or particular observations at this stage of the process.
  </p>
  <p>The order in which the schemata were sent is as follows:</p>
  <p>1972‚Äîthe schema on administrative procedure;</p>
  <p>1973‚Äîthe schema on sanctions in the Church;</p>
  <p>1975‚Äîthe schema on the sacraments;</p>
  <p>
    1976‚Äîthe schema on the procedure for the protection of rights or
    processes;
  </p>
  <p>
    1977‚Äîthe schema on institutes of life consecrated by the profession
    of the evangelical counsels, the schema on general norms, the schema
    on the people of God, the schema on the Church‚Äôs teaching office,
    the schema on sacred times and places and divine worship, and the
    schema on the patrimonial law of the Church.
  </p>
  <p>
    Undoubtedly the revised Code could not have been appropriately
    prepared without the inestimable and continuous cooperation afforded
    the Commission by numerous very valid animadversions especially of a
    pastoral character offered by bishops and conferences of bishops.
    The bishops submitted very many written animadversions, either
    general ones on the schemata considered as a whole or particular
    ones on individual canons.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of great benefit also were those general and particular
    animadversions submitted by the sacred congregations, tribunals and
    other institutes of the Roman Curia, based on their experience in
    the central government of the Church. This was also true for the
    scientific and technical proposals and suggestions offered by
    ecclesiastical universities and faculties reflecting different
    schools and ways of thinking.
  </p>
  <p>
    The study, examination and collegial discussion of all the
    animadversions, general and particular, which were forwarded to the
    Commission constituted a weighty and veritably immense burden which
    lasted seven years. The Secretariat of the Commission took pains
    carefully to organize and synthesize all the animadversions,
    proposals and suggestions which, after they had been forwarded to
    the consultors and carefully examined by them, were subsequently
    collegially discussed in working sessions conducted by the ten study
    groups.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every animadversion was considered with the utmost care and
    diligence. This was true even in the case of animadversions
    contradicting one another (which frequently happened). Due
    consideration was given not only to their sociological importance
    (namely, the number of consultative organs and persons who proposed
    them), but especially to their doctrinal and pastoral value, their
    coherence with the doctrine and implementing norms of the Second
    Vatican Council, the pontifical magisterium, and their necessary
    coherence with the juridic canonical system when examined from a
    specifically technical and scientific standpoint. In fact, as often
    as it was a case of a doubtful matter or when questions of special
    importance were debated, the opinion of the cardinal members of the
    Commission was sought during one of their plenary sessions. In other
    cases in view of the specific matter under discussion, the
    Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and other dicasteries of
    the Roman Curia were consulted. Finally, many corrections and
    changes were incorporated in the canons of the early schemata at the
    request or suggestion of the bishops and other consultative organs,
    so that some schemata were entirely renewed or changed.
  </p>
  <p>
    After all the schemata had been reworked, the Secretariat of the
    Commission and the consultors undertook a further weighty task. It
    was a matter of seeing to an internal coordination of all the
    schemata, of ensuring a uniform terminology throughout especially
    from a technical-juridic standpoint, of drafting canons in brief and
    elegant formulations, and finally of definitively determining a
    systematic organization so that all of the schemata, prepared by
    distinct study groups, could be integrated into one completely
    harmonious Code.
  </p>
  <p>
    The new systematic organization which, as it were, spontaneously
    emerged slowly during the revision process, is based on two
    principles, one of which is fidelity to the more general principles
    already determined by the central committee, the other of which is
    its practical usefulness so that the new Code can be easily
    understood and used not only by experts but also by pastors and
    indeed by all members of the Christian faithful.
  </p>
  <p>
    The new Code therefore consists of seven books which are entitled:
    General Norms, The People of God, The Teaching Function of the
    Church, The Sanctifying Function of the Church, The Temporal Goods
    of the Church, Sanctions in the Church, and Processes. Even if the
    different rubrics which precede the individual books of the old and
    new Code appear to indicate sufficiently the differences between the
    two systems, nonetheless the systematic innovations of the new Code
    are much more evident in light of its parts, sections, titles and
    rubrics. But it is certain that the new organization not only
    corresponds better to the proper matter and character of canon law
    than the old organization, but also, and what is of greater
    importance, the new is more in keeping with the ecclesiology of the
    Second Vatican Council and those principles flowing from it which
    were proposed at the very outset of the revision process.
  </p>
  <p>
    On June 29, 1980, the solemnity of the blessed Apostles Peter and
    Paul, the printed schema of the whole Code was presented to the
    Supreme Pontiff, who decided it was to be forwarded to the cardinal
    members of the Commission for their definitive examination and
    judgment. In order to highlight even more the participation of the
    whole Church in the last phase of the revision process, the Supreme
    Pontiff determined that other members be added to the Commission,
    cardinals and even bishops selected from the whole Church,
    conferences of bishops or councils or groups of conferences of
    bishops proposing candidates. Thus the expanded Commission numbered
    seventy-four members. At the beginning of 1981 they forwarded many
    animadversions which subsequently were subjected to a careful
    examination, diligent study and collegial discussion by the
    Secretariat of the Commission, with the help of consultors endowed
    with special expertise in the individual issues being discussed. A
    synthesis of all the animadversions together with the responses
    given by the Secretariat and the consultors was forwarded to the
    members of the Commission in August, 1981.
  </p>
  <p>
    A plenary session was convoked by order of the Supreme Pontiff to
    deliberate on the entire text of the new Code and to cast a
    definitive vote on it. The session took place October 20-28, 1981 in
    the aula of the synod of bishops. There was a discussion of six
    questions of particular weight and importance as well as of other
    questions proposed at the request of at least ten Fathers. At the
    end of the plenary session, the Fathers unanimously responded placet
    (affirmatively) to the following question: whether it pleased the
    Fathers that, after the examination during the plenary session of
    the schema of the Code and the emendations already introduced, the
    same schema along with the changes which had received a majority
    vote during the plenary session was worthy of being presented as
    soon as possible to the Supreme Pontiff, who would issue the Code at
    a time and in a way which seemed best. Consideration was also to be
    given to other animadversions which had been presented as well as to
    a certain polishing of the text regarding its style and Latinity
    (which tasks were entrusted to the president and the Secretariat).
  </p>
  <p>
    The entire text of the Code thereby reworked and approved was
    enlarged by the addition of canons from the schema on the
    Fundamental Law of the Church which had to be inserted in the Code
    in light of the material with which they dealt. After the Latin
    style of the text was further polished, it was printed and given to
    the Supreme Pontiff on April 22, 1982 with a view toward
    promulgation.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Supreme Pontiff, however, personally reviewed this latest schema
    with the help of certain experts and in consultation with the
    pro-president of the Pontifical Commission for the Revision of the
    Code of Canon Law. After mature consideration the Supreme Pontiff
    decreed that the new Code was to be promulgated on January 25, 1983,
    i.e., the anniversary of the first announcement by Pope John XXIII
    of the undertaking of the Code‚Äôs revision.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since after nearly twenty years the pontifical commission
    established for this purpose has felicitously completed the
    difficult task entrusted to it, there is now available to pastors
    and other members of the Christian faithful the most recent law of
    the Church, which is characterized by simplicity, precision,
    elegance and true legal science. Furthermore, since it is fully
    pervaded by charity, equity, humanity and a true Christian spirit,
    it attempts to correspond to the divinely given external and
    internal characteristics of the Church. It also seeks to take
    cognizance of the conditions and needs of the contemporary world.
    But if on account of the excessively swift changes in contemporary
    human society certain elements of the new law become less perfect
    and require a new review, the Church is endowed with such a wealth
    of resources that, not unlike prior centuries, it will be able to
    undertake the task of renewing the laws of its life.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, however, the law can no longer be unknown. Pastors have at
    their disposal secure norms by which they may correctly direct the
    exercise of the sacred ministry. To each person is given a source of
    knowing his or her own proper rights and duties. Arbitrariness in
    acting can be precluded. Abuses which perhaps have crept into
    ecclesiastical discipline because of a lack of legislation can be
    more easily rooted out and prevented. Finally, all the works,
    institutes and initiatives of the apostolate may progress
    expeditiously and may be promoted since a healthy juridic
    organization is quite necessary for the ecclesiastical community to
    live, grow and flourish. May our most gracious God grant this
    through the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Mother of
    the Church, her spouse St. Joseph, Patron of the Church, and Saints
    Peter and Paul.
