    <h3 class="sectionnumber" id="intro1">1. The Need for a New Ratio Fundamentalis Institutionis Sacerdotalis</h3>
    <p>The gift of the priestly vocation, placed by God in the hearts of some men, obliges the Church to propose to them a serious journey of formation. As Pope Francis recalled on the occasion of his address to the Plenary of the Congregation for the Clergy (3 October 2014): “It means guarding and fostering vocations, that they may bear mature fruit. They are ‘uncut diamonds’, to be formed both patiently and carefully, respecting the conscience of the individual, so that they may shine among the People of God”<span class="footnumber">(1)</span><span class="footnote">FRANCIS, <i>Address to the Plenary of the Congregation for Clergy</i> (3 October 2014): <i>L'Osservatore Romano</i>, 226 (4 October 2014), 8.</span></p>
    <p>It was some thirty years ago – on 19 March 1985 – that the Congregation for Catholic Education, then competent in this matter, proceeded to amend the <i>Ratio Fundamentalis Institutionis Sacerdotalis</i> promulgated on 6 January 1970<span class="footnumber">(2)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. CONGREGATION FOR CATHOLIC EDUCATION, <i>Ratio Fundamentalis Institutiones Sacerdotalis</i> (6 January 1970): <i>AAS</i> 62 (1970), 321-384.</span>, above all by updating the footnotes in light of the promulgation of the Code of Canon Law (25 January 1983).</p>
    <p>Since then there have been numerous contributions on the theme of the formation of future priests, both on the part of the Universal Church and on the part of the Conferences of Bishops and individual particular Churches.</p>
    <p>It is necessary above all to recall the Magisterium of the Pontiffs who have guided the Church in this time: Saint John Paul II, to whom we owe the ground-breaking Post-Synodal Apostolic Exhortation <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i> (25 March 1992); Benedict XVI, author of the Apostolic Letter ‘motu proprio’ <i>Ministrorum Institutio</i> (16 January 2013); and Francis, whose encouragement and suggestions gave rise to the present document. </p>
    <p><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, in particular, explicitly sets out an integrated vision of the formation of future clerics, taking equal account of all four dimensions that involve the person of the seminarian: human, intellectual, spiritual and pastoral. <i>Ministrorum Institutio</i> seeks to show how the formation of seminarians finds a natural continuation in the ongoing formation of priests, so that the two form one single reality. For this reason, Benedict XVI decided to entrust responsibility for initial formation in the Seminary to the Congregation for the Clergy, which was already competent for the ongoing formation of clergy. He amended, therefore, the relevant articles of the Apostolic Constitution <i>Pastor Bonus</i> (28 June 1988), and transferred the Office for Seminaries to the Congregation for the Clergy. During his pontificate, Pope Francis has offered a rich Magisterium and a constant personal example regarding the ministry and life of priests, encouraging and supporting the work that has led to this present document. </p>
    <p>In these years there have been plenty of documents issued by Dicasteries of the Roman Curia, regarding particular aspects of the formation of future priests – the Congregation for Catholic Education, the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, as well as the Congregation for the Clergy – not to mention the various national formation programmes, many of which have been consulted in the course of this work.<span class="footnumber">(3)</span><span class="footnote">These documents will be mentioned in detail, and taken into account in a specific way, in the text which follows.</span></p>
    <h3 class="sectionnumber" id="intro2">2. Preparatory Stages</h3>
    <p>The Congregation for the Clergy began preparing the first draft of the present <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i> in the Spring of 2014. It was sent to some experts and, in particular, to the Members of the Dicastery, in preparation for the Plenary Assembly of the Congregation, which took place from 1 to 3 October 2014. During that Plenary, the text was discussed and commented upon by the Cardinal and Bishop Members, and by the invited experts, who offered proposals and suggestions for the progress of the work. </p>
    <p>This material was used to draw up a fuller text, enriched by the suggestions received from a number of Dicasteries of the Roman Curia, both those with an interest in the question by virtue of their competence (the Congregation for the Evangelisation of Peoples, the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, and the Congregation for the Oriental Churches), and those with a previously acquired experience in the field (the Congregation for Catholic Education).</p>
    <p>During 2015, the text was sent to numerous Conferences of Bishops and Apostolic Nunciatures, in order to seek their opinion and to broaden the scope of the consultation and reflection, so as to include countries in which the <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i> will be applied, in the spirit of synodality that is so frequently highlighted by Pope Francis.</p>
    <p>The Congregation for the Clergy also organised an International Conference, held on 19 and 20 November 2015, to mark the 50th anniversary of the conciliar documents <i>Optatam Totius</i> and <i>Presbyterorum Ordinis</i>, during which Cardinals, Bishops, professors, formators and experts offered their own valuable contributions to the discussion of the formation of candidates for Holy Orders. </p>
    <p>The Congregation for the Clergy, taking into due consideration the contributions received, then prepared a definitive draft. This was examined firstly by some Consultors, and was then presented to a number of Dicasteries of the Roman Curia (the Secretariat of State, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, the Congregation for Bishops, the Congregation for the Evangelisation of Peoples, the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, the Congregation for Catholic Education, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, the Congregation for the Oriental Churches, the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts), in accordance with the spirit of co-responsibility and cooperation that is encouraged by Article 17 of the Apostolic Constitution <i>Pastor Bonus.</i></p>
    <p>At the end of this process of consultation and in light of the suggestions received, a definitive text was drafted, to be placed before Pope Francis for his approval, according to Article 18 of <i>Pastor Bonus.</i></p>
    <h3 class="sectionnumber" id="intro3">3. Characteristic Elements and Fundamental Content</h3>
    <p>The journey of priestly formation, beginning with the Seminary years, is described in the present <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i> in terms of four characteristic elements of formation, understood as one, integral, grounded in community and missionary in spirit. </p>
    <p>The formation of priests means following a singular ‘journey of discipleship’, which begins at Baptism, is perfected through the other sacraments of Christian Initiation, comes to be appreciated as the centre of one’s life at the beginning of Seminary formation, and continues through the whole of life.</p>
    <p>Formation – both initial and ongoing – must be seen through a unifying lens, which takes account of the four dimensions of formation proposed by <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>. Together, these dimensions give shape and structure to the identity of the seminarian and the priest, and make him capable of that ‘gift of self to the Church’, which is the essence of pastoral charity. The entire journey of formation must never be reduced to a single aspect to the detriment of others, but it must always be an integrated journey of the disciple called to priesthood.</p>
    <p>This formation has an eminently communitarian character from the outset. In fact, the vocation to the priesthood is a gift that God gives to the Church and to the world, a path to sanctify oneself and others that should not be followed in an individualistic manner, but must always have as its point of reference a specific portion of the People of God. Such a vocation is discovered and accepted within a community. It is formed in the Seminary, in the context of an educating community, comprised of various members of the People of God. This community leads the seminarian, through ordination, to become part of the ‘family’ of the presbyterate, at the service of a particular community. With respect to the priest formators, this <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i> wishes to emphasise that, for the effectiveness of their endeavours, they must consider themselves to be a true formative community. They should act accordingly, sharing a common responsibility, with due regard to the duties and the office entrusted to each member. </p>
    <p>Since the priest-disciple comes from the Christian community, and will be sent back to it, to serve it and to guide it as a pastor, formation is clearly missionary in character. Its goal is participation in the one mission entrusted by Christ to His Church, that is evangelisation, in all its forms. </p>
    <p>The fundamental idea is that Seminaries should form missionary disciples who are ‘in love’ with the Master, shepherds ‘with the smell of the sheep’, who live in their midst to bring the mercy of God to them. Hence every priest should always feel that he is a disciple on a journey, constantly needing an integrated formation, understood as a continuous configuration to Christ. </p>
    <p>Within this single integrated and continuous formation, two phases can be identified, namely initial and ongoing. In this <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, initial formation is divided into various stages: the propaedeutic stage, the study of Philosophy or the discipleship stage; the study of theology or the configurative stage, and the pastoral stage or that of vocational synthesis. </p>
    <p>Seen in these terms, the journey of formation has developed in several ways since the <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i> of 1970. Following the experimentation and trial period, begun by the Synod of Bishops of 1990 (VIII General Assembly), the ‘propaedeutic stage’, with its specific identity and formative purpose, is now presented as necessary and mandatory.</p>
    <p>As regards the ‘discipleship’ and ‘configuration’ stages, these terms are placed alongside the customary periods of ‘philosophical studies’ and ‘theological studies’, which are intended to last for six years altogether.<span class="footnumber">(4)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. C.I.C., can 250.</span> Moreover, it should be emphasised that the intellectual dimension, with the prescribed study of philosophy and theology, is not the only factor to be considered when evaluating the journey completed by the seminarian in each stage, and the progress that has been made. Rather the overall discernment by the formators regarding all the aspects of formation will allow only those seminarians to pass on to the next stage who, in addition to having passed the necessary exams, have reached the level of human and vocational maturity required for each stage.</p>
    <p>Finally, the ‘pastoral stage’, or the ‘stage of vocational synthesis’, is intended to give particular importance to the period between the end of formation in the Seminary and priestly ordination, with the purpose of helping the candidate to acquire the necessary understanding in preparation for it. </p>
    <p>Discipleship and configuration to Christ, obviously, last throughout life. The terms ‘discipleship stage’ and ‘configuration stage’ are intended to focus attention on two moments of initial formation, on the special attention to be given to the awareness of being disciples, and on the need to understand the call to ministry and priestly life as a continuous configuration to Christ. </p>
    <p>As for ongoing formation, by its nature this cannot be set out in ready made ‘stages’. For this reason, only certain moments, situations and tools have been mentioned. These may be of help to priests and to those engaged in the task of ongoing formation, so as to experience and to offer concrete initiatives. </p>
    <p>A further integral part of this <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, as of the 1970 edition, is the <i>Ordo Studiorum</i>. This provides a descriptive list of materials that must included in the course of studies for seminarians, during the various phases, within the wider intellectual formation. It must be applied in its entirety in Seminaries and in those houses of formation that offer the prescribed six years of philosophy and theology courses internally. Such houses of formation, naturally, will also offer the courses of the propaedeutic stage and those which pertain specifically to ministry.</p>
    <p>Guidelines of various kinds – theological, spiritual, pedagogical, canonical – are offered in the text of this <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, along with actual norms, which mirror those of the Code of Canon Law, and determine more precisely the manner of their application.<span class="footnumber">(5)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. CIC, can. 31, § 1.</span> Guidelines and norms have not been rigidly separated in the document, though the mandatory or advisory nature of each passage has been made clear. Instead these two elements have been integrated into the document, in order to provide a text enriched by considerations and perspectives of various kinds.</p>

Taking into account, however, the Conciliar decree <i>Ad Gentes</i>, n. 16, and Article 88 §2 of the Apostolic Constitution <i>Pastor Bonus</i>, it applies in part to those territories within the competence of the Congregation for the Evangelisation of Peoples. In fact, although that Dicastery has the duty ‘to form the secular clergy’, according to its own guidelines and norms, this <i>Ratio</i> is normative as regards the ‘General Plan of Studies’ also for those countries under the competence of the Congregation for the Evangelisation of Peoples. Moreover, the <i>Rationes</i> of the following entities must be conformed to the <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, with the necessary adaptations: Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life<span class="footnumber">(7)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. JOHN PAUL II, Apostolic Constitution <i>Pastor Bonus</i> (28 June 1988), articles 88, § 2 and 108, § 2: <i>AAS</i> 80 (1988), 882 and 887.</span>, dependent on the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, on the Congregation for the Evangelisation of Peoples, as well as on the Pontifical Commission <i>Ecclesia Dei</i>, insofar as it pertains to “<i>members who are being prepared for sacred orders</i>”<span class="footnumber">(8)</span><span class="footnote">CIC, can 659, § 3.</span> ; Clerical Associations who have been granted the right to incardinate clerics; Personal Prelatures; Military Ordinariates; and Personal Ordinariates.<span class="footnumber">(9)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. BENEDICT XVI, Apostolic Constitution <i>Anglicanorum Coetibus</i> (4 November 2009): <i>AAS</i> 101 (2009), 985-990.</span> For this reason, when reference is made to competences of the Ordinary, this includes Major Superiors of Clerical Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life of pontifical right, unless it is clear from the context that only the diocesan Bishop is intended.</p>
      <p>In accordance with the norms of Articles 56 and 58 §2 of the Apostolic Constitution <i>Pastor Bonus</i>, this <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i> does not apply to the Eastern Catholic Churches subject to the competence of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches. They must prepare their own norms on this subject, based on their own liturgical, theological, spiritual and disciplinary patrimony.</p>
      <p>It should be noted that in houses of formation of movements and of new ecclesial communities, this <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, along with the <i>Ratio Nationalis</i> prepared by the Conference of Bishops of the country in which the institute is found, is to be applied in its entirety, under the authority of the diocesan Bishop. Regarding the academic study of philosophy and theology, as defined in canonical, ecclesiastical or civil legislation, and regarding ecclesiastical faculties, the Congregation for Catholic Education is competent.<span class="footnumber">(10)</span><span class="footnote">The respective competencies of the two Dicasteries were established by BENEDICT XVI, Apostolic Letter motu proprio <i>Ministrorum Institutio</i> (16 January 2013), art 6: <i>AAS</i> 105 (2013), 134: "<i>The Congregation for Catholic Education is competent to structure the academic curricula of philosophy and theology, after consultation with the Congregation for the Clergy in areas of its respective competence</i>".</span> Furthermore the same Congregation is responsible for maintaining accords with the competent civil authorities</p>
      <p id="2"><span class="sectionnumber">§2 </span>The Congregation for the Clergy, which is responsible for the Pontifical Work for Priestly Vocations,<span class="footnumber">(11)</span><span class="footnote">Cf.

      <p>In this way, the Congregation for the Clergy promotes the pastoral care of vocations, especially vocations to Holy Orders, and offers Bishops and Conferences of Bishops principles and norms for the initial and ongoing formation of clerics.</p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible title2">b) Preparation of the Ratio Nationalis</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p id="3"><span class="sectionnumber">§3 </span>Each Conference of Bishops is required to prepare its own <i>Ratio Nationalis</i> on the basis of this <i>Ratio Fundamentalis Institutionis Sacerdotalis</i>, which, in accordance with no. 1 of the Conciliar Decree <i>Optatam Totius</i> and can. 242 §1 of the Code of Canon Law, must be approved by this same Congregation, after having heard the opinion of the Congregation for Catholic Education on matters within its competence. This is to ensure the necessary harmonisation and coordination of the Programme of Studies and its consistency with the Programme of Studies of individual countries. </p>
      <p>Whenever it may prove necessary to make changes to a previously approved <i>Ratio Nationalis</i>, due to new or unexpected developments, the text may be amended by seeking the further approval of the Congregation for the Clergy. The <i>Ratio Nationalis</i> will require revision by the competent committee of the Conference of Bishops on the basis of accumulated experience, or upon the expiry of a fixed term, and should be submitted once again for the approval of this Dicastery. Further revisions and the necessary approvals can and must be undertaken and requested periodically, whenever it seems necessary to the Conference of Bishops or when, for a just cause, the Congregation for the Clergy considers it opportune.<span class="footnumber">(13)</span><span class="footnote">Cf.

CIC, can. 242, § 2.</span></p>
      <p id="7"><span class="sectionnumber">§7 </span>The <i>Ratio Nationalis</i> must make reference to the dimensions of formation of candidates for the priesthood presented in this document, in such a way that the candidates can be integrally formed and properly prepared for the challenges of our time. Each <i>Ratio Nationalis</i> must also specify the stages of formation and the programme of studies, their objectives and their length, respecting the norms of universal law. In its vision of education for the priesthood, the <i>Ratio Nationalis</i> must ensure the necessary harmonisation across the whole country, while also bearing in mind any cultural diversity that may exist.</p>
      <p>Each <i>Ratio Nationalis</i> must, in its own context, express and give effect to what is envisaged in the <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, and should always include the following elements:
      <ol type="a">
        <li>at least a summary description of the particular social, cultural and ecclesial context, in which the future priests will find themselves exercising their ministry;</li>
        <li>a summary of any agreements that may have been reached by the Conference of Bishops concerning the organisation of Seminaries in its country;</li>
        <li>some references to the pastoral care of vocations and the means available;</li>

        <li>the programme of propaedeutic, philosophical and theological studies, including a presentation of the subjects, with some indication of the objectives and content of each, along with the number of credits required for each discipline.</li>
      </ol>
      </p>
      <p id="8"><span class="sectionnumber">§8 </span>In preparing the <i>Ratio Nationalis</i>, each Conference of Bishops should take into due consideration the characteristics and specific demands of its own socioeducational environment. Moreover, cooperation between the different Ecclesiastical Circumscriptions in the territory should be encouraged, paying attention to local circumstances, in order to guarantee the best programme of formation possible, as much in the larger Seminaries as in the smaller ones</p>
      <p>According to the prudent judgement of each Conference of Bishops, the <i>iter</i> of the drafting and subsequent revisions of the <i>Ratio Nationalis</i> could involve a process of consultation. First of all, the Conference of Bishops, by means of persons duly appointed to the task, could consult the Seminaries directly and, where it exists, also the national organisation for Seminaries. The Conference could then entrust the preparation of a base text to the Episcopal Commission for Clergy and Seminaries. Finally, in a spirit of collegiality and cooperation, the Conference of Bishops must proceed to the final drafting of the text.</p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible title2">d) National and International Seminary Organisations</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p id="9"><span class="sectionnumber">§9 </span>The establishment of supra-diocesan Seminary Organisations is encouraged whenever circumstances make this possible, or where similar initiatives are already underway. In fact, entities of this kind can provide valuable assistance, insofar as they can be a consultative means of communication and cooperation between formators working in different institutions. They can promote the analysis and homogenous development of educational and didactic experiences at the regional level, or a greater exchange and comparison at the international level. </p>
      <p>The members of organisations of this kind will be drawn from the formators of the different institutions. It will be important that these organisations operate under the guidance of the Commission for Clergy and Seminaries of the Conference of Bishops. In any case, in a spirit of ecclesial communion, it is the responsibility of the Congregation for the Clergy to erect such organisations on a universal level. It belongs, however, to the Conferences of Bishops or to the various organisations of the same (for example, the Consejo Episcopal Latinoamericano [CELAM], the Consilium Conferentiarium Episcoporum Europae [CCEE], the Federation of Asian Bishops’ Conferences [FABC], etc.), having consulted this Dicastery, to set up organisations operative within their territories or their continent, approving their Statutes while respecting the competences of individual diocesan Bishops and Conferences of Bishops.</p>
      <p>As already happens in some regions, it could be of great help were such organisations to promote, within the territory of their competence, courses for formators and opportunities for the study of themes linked to vocations and to priestly formation. The results of these initiatives may then be made available to the relevant Conferences of Bishops.<span class="footnumber">(18)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. <i>Optatam Totius</i>, n. 5: <i>AAS</i> 58 (1966), 716-717.</span></p>

      <p id="16"><span class="sectionnumber">§16 </span>The pastoral care of vocations seeks to recognise and accompany the response that is made to the interior call of the Lord. This process must foster the growth of the human and spiritual qualities of the person, and evaluate the authenticity of his motives. For these reasons, it is fitting that institutions suitable for the support and discernment of vocations to the ministerial priesthood should be encouraged in each particular Church. These must take into account its circumstances, means and acquired experience, along with the age and particular circumstances of those who will be formed there.</p>

      <p id="18"><span class="sectionnumber">§18 </span>The purpose of the Minor Seminary is to assist the human and Christian growth of adolescents,<span class="footnumber">(33)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. <i>Apostolorum Successores</i>, n. 86.</span> who manifest the seeds of a vocation to the ministerial priesthood. It develops, in a way appropriate to their age, that interior freedom by which they can make a response to the plan of God for their lives.</p>
      <p>In places where this service is not provided institutionally in a Minor Seminary, each local Church should take on the important task of accompanying adolescents, by promoting new approaches and experimenting with creative pastoral initiatives, so as to help and direct their human and spiritual growth. Among many examples that can be named are youth vocations groups, communities for vocational discernment, Catholic colleges, and other youth organisations.<span class="footnumber">(34)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, n. 64: <i>AAS</i> 84 (1992), 769-770.</span></p>
      <p id="19"><span class="sectionnumber">§19 </span>In Minor Seminaries the qualities of the young men must be considered, along with the specific ‘signs of a vocation’. Concretely, it will be of great help to evaluate previous experiences that have marked the life of faith of the young men. Examples of this would be the spiritual bond with a priest; frequent recourse to the sacraments; the beginnings of a prayer life; the ecclesial experience of the parish or of groups, movements and associations; participation in vocational activities promoted by the Diocese; undertaking some task in the service of the ecclesial reality to which they belong. It is also necessary to consider some human qualities which, if they were suitably developed, can help the young men to advance in their vocational maturity. It is for the formators, therefore, to verify the overall suitability of those who might become candidates (spiritual, physical, psychological, moral and intellectual).</p>
      <p id="20"><span class="sectionnumber">§20 </span>During the vocational journey of the Minor Seminary, it will be necessary to take into account the growth dynamic of the person, in a way that is age-appropriate and pays particular attention to the following aspects: sincerity and ease with himself and others, gradual emotional development, openness to live in community, capacity for cultivating brotherly friendships, a sense of responsibility about his own duties and the tasks entrusted to him, creativity and a spirit of initiative, the right expression of freedom, openness to a journey of prayer and of encounter with Christ.</p>
      <p id="21"><span class="sectionnumber">§21 </span>By experiencing friendship with Jesus, the young men should learn to live and develop their fidelity to the Lord, supported by prayer and by the strength of the Holy Spirit. In this way they are to mature in humble service, understood as availability to others and concern for the common good; obedience, lived as a trustful listening; youthful chastity, as a sign of the transparency of relationships and the gift of self; and poverty, as a formation in the temperate use of material things and in a life of simplicity.</p>
      <p>An essential element of this spiritual formation is the liturgical and sacramental life, in which the young will have to participate ever more consciously, in accordance with their age, as they grow up. Another important element is Marian devotion and other pious exercises practised daily or periodically, to be set out, like all the other matters, in the Rule of Life of each Seminary.</p>
      <p id="22"><span class="sectionnumber">§22 </span>Young people should receive the education required by their own country for entrance to university.<span class="footnumber">(35)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. CIC, can. 234, § 2.</span> Moreover, they should seek to obtain state-recognised academic qualifications, which will also allow them the freedom and the possibility of choosing another state of life, if it were to transpire that they were not called to the priesthood. It would also be fitting for the Seminary to offer a complementary formation, which would take into account, for example, culture, art and sport, etc. Studies can take place either in the school of the Seminary itself, in some other Catholic school or elsewhere.</p>
      <p id="23"><span class="sectionnumber">§23 </span>Given the importance and the need for a challenging formation during adolescence, in which the identities of the young men begin to mature, it is necessary that they be accompanied by formators who understand the requirements of their age and who are good educators and witnesses of the Gospel. It is desirable that formators can work together with parents who, at this stage above all, have a fundamental role in the process of growth of their sons. It is likewise desirable to have the support and involvement of their home parish communities. Moreover, formators should take care that seminarians maintain suitable, and also necessary, relationships with their own families and with their peers. They will need such relationships for a healthy psychological development, especially where the affective life is concerned.</p>

    <div class="content">

The task of formation is to help the person to integrate these aspects, under the influence of the Holy Spirit, in a journey of faith and of gradual and harmonious maturity, avoiding fragmentation, polarisation, excesses, superficiality or partiality. The time of formation for priestly ministry is a period of testing, maturing and discernment by both the seminarian and the house of formation.</p>

      <p id="32"><span class="sectionnumber">§32 </span>Every believer is anointed by the Holy Spirit, and actively participates in the mission of the Church according to his own proper charisms.

      <p>Consequently, future priests should be educated so that they do not become prey to ‘clericalism’, nor yield to the temptation of modelling their lives on the search for popular consensus.

      <p>In conclusion, the priestly vocation begins with the gift of divine grace, which is then sealed in sacramental ordination. This gift is expressed over time through the mediation of the Church, which calls and sends in the name of God. At the same time, the personal response develops through a process, which begins with an awareness of the gift received, and matures gradually with the help of priestly spirituality, until it becomes a stable way of life, with its own obligations and rights, and a specific mission accepted by the one ordained.</p>

      <p>True God and true man, Christ brought to fulfilment, in love, the realities that preceded him: priesthood (cf. Heb 7:1-28), covenant (cf. 8:1-9,28), sacrifice (cf. 10:1-18). The sacrifice offered by Christ the Priest was new in a particular way: he did not offer the blood of goats or of calves, but his own blood, to do the will of the Father. The words of Jesus in the Upper Room, “<i>This is my body, which will be given for you; do this in memory of me […] This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which will be shed for you</i>” (cf.

      <p id="41"><span class="sectionnumber">§41 </span>The pastoral care of the faithful demands that the priest have a solid formation and interior maturity. He cannot limit himself simply to demonstrating a ‘veneer of virtuous habits’, a merely external and formalistic obedience to abstract principles. Rather, he is called to act with great interior freedom. Indeed, it is expected of him that, day after day, he will internalise the spirit of the Gospel, thanks to a constant and personal friendship with Christ, leading him to share His sentiments and His attitudes.</p>
      <p>Thus, by growing in charity, the future priest must seek to develop a balanced and mature capacity to enter into relationship with his neighbour. Indeed, he is called above all to a basic human and spiritual serenity<span class="footnumber">(65)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. ID., <i>Addres to the Participants in the Convention Sponsored by the Congregation for the Clergy on the 50th Anniversary of the Conciliar Decrees 'Optatam Totius' and 'Presbyterorum Ordinis'</i> (20 November 2015): <i>L'Osservatore Romano</i> 267 (21 November 2015), 8.</span> that, by overcoming every form of self-promotion or emotional dependency, allows him to be a man of communion, of mission and of dialogue.<span class="footnumber">(66)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, n. 18: <i>AAS</i> 84 (1992), 684-686.</span> In contemplating the Lord, who offered His life for others, he will be able to give himself generously and with self-sacrifice for the People of God.</p>
      <p id="42"><span class="sectionnumber">§42 </span>To be formed in the spirit of the Gospel, the interior man needs to take special and faithful care of the interior spiritual life, centred principally on communion with Christ through the Mysteries celebrated in the course of the Liturgical Year, and nourished by personal prayer and meditation on the inspired Word. In silent prayer, which opens him to an authentic relationship with Christ, the seminarian becomes docile to the action of the Spirit, which gradually moulds him in the image of the Master. By this intimate relationship with the Lord and by their fraternal communion, seminarians will be helped to recognise and correct ‘spiritual worldliness’: obsession with personal appearances, a presumed theological or disciplinary certainty, narcissism and authoritarianism, the attempt to dominate others, a merely external and ostentatious preoccupation with the liturgy, vainglory, individualism, the inability to listen to others, and every form of careerism.<span class="footnumber">(67)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. <i>Evangelii Gaudium</i>, nn. 93-97: <i>AAS</i> 105 (2013), 1059-1061.</span> They should instead be formed in simplicity, sobriety, serene dialogue and authenticity. As disciples at the school of the Master, they should learn to live and act with the pastoral charity that flows from being “<i>servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God</i>” (cf. 1Cor 4:1).</p>
      <p id="43"><span class="sectionnumber">§43 </span>Priestly formation is a journey of transformation that renews the heart and mind of the person, so that he can “<i>discern what is the will of God, what is good and pleasing and perfect</i>” (cf. Rom 12:2). Indeed, the gradual inner growth along the journey of formation should principally be aimed at making the future priest a ‘man of discernment’, able to read the reality of human life in the light of the Spirit. In this way he will be able to choose, decide and act according to the will of God.</p>
      <p>The first area of discernment is the personal life. It is necessary to integrate one’s own personal situation and history into the spiritual life. This will ensure that the vocation to the priesthood does not become imprisoned in an abstract ideal, nor run the risk of reducing itself to a merely practical and organisational activism, removed from the conscience of the person. Discerning one’s life according to the Gospel means cultivating every day a deep spiritual life, so as to receive it and interpret it with full responsibility, and a growing trust in God, directing the heart towards Him each day.<span class="footnumber">(68)</span><span class="footnote">This is "<i>the fundamental question of our priestly life: Where is my heart directed? It is a question we need to keep asking daily, weekly... Where is my heart directed?</i>", FRANCIS, <i>Homily for the Jubilee of Priests and Seminarians</i> (3 June 2016). <i>L'Osservatore Romano</i> 126 (4 June 2016), 8.</span></p>
      <p>This means working humbly and ceaselessly on oneself – something that goes beyond mere introspection – so that the priest opens himself honestly to the truths of life and to the real demands of ministry. He learns to listen to the conscience that judges his movements and the interior urges that motivate his actions. In this way, the priest learns to govern himself using the spiritual and mental powers of mind and body. He grasps the sense of what can be done and what it would be better not to do, or what should not be done. He begins to organise his energies, his plans and his duties with a balanced self-discipline and an honest awareness of his own limits and abilities. This work cannot be undertaken satisfactorily by relying only on his own human resources. On the contrary, it relies principally on welcoming the gift of divine grace, that enables him to transcend himself, to go beyond his own needs and external conditioning, to live in the freedom of the children of God. It is a way of ‘looking within’ and a holistic spiritual outlook, which directs the whole of his life and ministry. In this way he learns how to act with prudence, and to judge the consequences of his actions beyond certain limited circumstances that can impede a clear judgement of things.</p>
      <p>This journey of being honest with oneself calls for a special care of the inner life by personal prayer, spiritual direction, daily contact with the Word of God, the contemplation of the priestly life in a spirit of faith along with other priests and the Bishop, and all the other means that help to cultivate the virtues of prudence and right judgement. In this ongoing path of discernment, the priest will learn how to interpret and understand his own motivations, his gifts, his needs and his frailties, so as to “<i>free himself from all disordered affections and, having removed them, to seek out and find the will of God in the ordering of his life with a view to the salvation of the soul</i>”.<span class="footnumber">(69)</span><span class="footnote">IGNATIUS OF LOYOLA, <i>Spiritual Exercises</i>, 1.</span></p>

Initial and ongoing formation are two aspects of one reality: the path of the disciple priest, in love with his Lord and steadfastly following Him."</i></span> – can be divided into two principal moments: initial formation in the Seminary and ongoing formation in priestly life.</p>
    <p id="55"><span class="sectionnumber">§55 </span><i>Initial</i> formation concerns the time leading up to priestly ordination, from the beginning of the propaedeutic period, which is an integral part of it. Therefore, this time must be characterised by the elements of formation that prepare the seminarian for priestly life. This calls for patient and demanding work on the person, who is open to the action of the Holy Spirit. Its purpose is to form a priestly heart.</p>

One is always a ‘disciple’ throughout the whole of life, constantly aspiring to configure oneself to Christ, by exercising pastoral ministry. Indeed, these dimensions are a constant feature of the journey of each seminarian, but some receive greater attention at particular stages over the course of formation, albeit never to the neglect of the others.</p>
      <p id="58"><span class="sectionnumber">§58 </span>At the conclusion of each stage, it is important to assess whether the aims of that particular period of formation have been achieved, taking account of periodic evaluations (preferably each semester, or at least annually), which the formators will prepare in writing. The attainment of formation objectives should not necessarily be tied to the time spent in the Seminary and especially not to the studies completed. That is to say, one should not arrive ‘automatically’ at the priesthood merely by reason of having followed a series of pre-established stages in chronological order and set out beforehand, independently of the actual progress that has been achieved in overall integral maturity. Rather, ordination is the goal of a genuinely completed spiritual journey, that has gradually helped the seminarian to become aware of the call he has received and the characteristics that pertain to priestly identity, allowing him to reach the necessary human, Christian and priestly maturity.</p>
      <p>The community of formators must be coherent and objective in the periodic integral assessments they make of seminarians, taking account of the four dimensions of formation, which will be addressed in Chapter V.

        <p id="59"><span class="sectionnumber">§59 </span>The experience of recent decades<span class="footnumber">(93)</span><span class="footnote">The propaedeutic stage follows the preliminary discernment of a vocation and the first vocational accompaniment outside the Seminary. Cf. <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, n. 62: <i>AAS</i> 84 (1992), 767-768. The Congregation for Catholic Education recommended, already by 1980, that this initial stage should be offered: "<i>The need to intensift the preparation of aspirants to Major Seminary has become pressing, not only from an intellectual point of view but also, and more especially, from the human and spiritual perspectives</i>", CONGREGATION FOR CATHOLIC EDUCATION, Information Document <i>The Propaedeutic Period</i> (10 May 1998), III, n. 1. The Congregation for the Evangelisation of Peoples, in a Circular letter of 25 April 1987, expressed its hope that the propaedeutic period might be "<i>a prolonged period of vocational discernment, of growth in the spiritual life and community life and, if needs be, a period in which cultural preparation can be supplemented with a view to the study of philosophy and theology.</i>": <i>Enchiridion Vaticanum</i> 10 (1989), 1214.</span> has revealed the need to dedicate a period of time to preparation of an introductory nature, in view of the priestly formation to follow or, alternatively, of the decision to follow a different path in life. Ordinarily this period is not to be less than one year or more than two.</p>
        <p>The propaedeutic stage is an indispensable phase of formation with its own specific character. Its principal objective is to provide a solid basis for the spiritual life and to nurture a greater self-awareness for personal growth. In order to launch and develop their spiritual life, it will be necessary to lead seminarians to prayer by way of the sacramental life; the Liturgy of the Hours; familiarity with the Word of God, which is to be considered the soul and guide of the journey; silence; mental prayer; and spiritual reading. Moreover, this time is an ideal opportunity to acquire an initial and overall familiarity with Christian doctrine by studying the <i>Catechism of the Catholic Church</i> and by developing the dynamic of self-giving through experiences in the parish setting and charitable works. Finally, if necessary, the propaedeutic stage can help to make up for anything that is missing in their general education.</p>
        <p>The studies of the propaedeutic stage are always to be considered entirely distinct from philosophical studies. </p>
        <p id="60"><span class="sectionnumber">§60 </span>The propaedeutic stage can be adapted according to the culture and experiences of the local Church. However, it must always be a real time of vocational discernment, undertaken within community life, and a ‘start’ to the following stages of <i>initial formation</i>.</p>
        <p>In the formation that is offered, emphasis should be placed on communion with one’s Bishop, with the presbyterate and with the entire particular Church, especially as quite a few vocations nowadays originate within various groups and movements, and so need to develop deeper bonds with the Diocese.<span class="footnumber">(94)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. <i>The Propaedeutic Period</i>, III, n. 5.</span></p>
        <p>It is fitting that the propaedeutic stage be lived in a community distinct from the Major Seminary and, where at all possible, that it should have its own house. A propaedeutic programme should be developed, therefore, with its own formators to provide a solid human and Christian formation and a careful selection of candidates for Major Seminary.<span class="footnumber">(95)</span><span class="footnote">FRANCIS, <i>Address to the Plenary of the Congregation for Clergy</i> (3 October 2014): <i>L'Osservatore Romano</i>, 226 (4 October 2014), 8: <i>"one must carefully study the evolution of a vocation! See whether it comes from the Lord, whether the man is healthy, whether the man is well-balanced, whether the man is capable of giving life, of evangelizing, whether the man is capable of forming a family and renouncing this in order to follow Jesus".</i></span>/p>
      </div> <button type="button" class="collapsible title3">a2) The Stage of Philosophical Studies (or Discipleship)</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p id="61"><span class="sectionnumber">§61 </span>The <i>concept of discipleship</i>. The disciple is the one whom the Lord has called to “stay with Him” (cf. Mk 3:14), to follow Him, and to become a missionary of the Gospel. Each day he learns how to enter into the secrets of the Kingdom of God, living a deep relationship with Jesus. Staying with Christ becomes a pedagogical-spiritual journey, that transforms the life of the seminarian and bears witness to His love in the world.</p>
        <p id="62"><span class="sectionnumber">§62 </span>The experience and dynamic of discipleship, that lasts, as we have noted, for the whole of life, and includes all priestly formation, pedagogically requires a specific stage in which all possible efforts are expended to root the seminarian in the sequela Christi, listening to His Word, keeping it in his heart and putting it into practice. This specific period is characterised by the formation of the disciple of Jesus who is destined to be a pastor. Special attention is given to the human dimension, in harmony with spiritual growth, so as to help the seminarian mature in his definitive decision to follow the Lord in ministerial priesthood, by embracing the evangelical counsels in a way proper to this stage.</p>
        <p id="63"><span class="sectionnumber">§63 </span>In preparing for the theological or configuration stage, and leading to a definitive choice for priesthood, this stage allows for systematic work on the personality of the seminarian, in openness to the Holy Spirit. For priestly formation the importance of human formation cannot be sufficiently emphasised. Indeed, the holiness of a priest is built upon it and depends, in large part, upon the authenticity and maturity of his humanity. The lack of a well structured and balanced personality is a serious and objective hindrance to the continuation of formation for the priesthood.</p>
        <p>For this reason, seminarians should become accustomed to training their character, they should grow in their strength of spirit and, generally speaking, they should learn human virtues, such as “<i>sincerity of mind, a constant concern for justice, fidelity to one’s promises, refinement in manners, modesty in speech coupled with charity</i>”.<span class="footnumber">(96)</span><span class="footnote"><i>Optatam Totius</i>, n. 11: <i>AAS</i>58 (1966), 720.</span> This will make them a living reflection of the humanity of Jesus and a bridge that unites people with God. In order to attain the solid physical, psycho-affective and social maturity required of a pastor, it is useful to have recourse to physical exercise and sports, along with preparation for a well-balanced lifestyle. As well as the irreplaceable accompaniment of the formators and the Spiritual Director, specific psychological accompaniment could be of help in some cases, to integrate the fundamental elements of the personality.</p>
        <p>This process of formation is intended to educate the person in the truth of his being, in freedom and in self-control. It is meant to overcome all kinds of individualism, and to foster the sincere gift of self, opening him to generous dedication to others.</p>
        <p id="64"><span class="sectionnumber">§64 </span>Growth in human maturity is assisted and brought about by divine grace, which gives direction to the growth of the spiritual life. This in turn helps the seminarian to live in the presence of God in an attitude of prayer, and it is based on his personal relationship with Christ, that consolidates the identity of disciplship.</p>
        <p id="65"><span class="sectionnumber">§65 </span>This is a transformative journey that involves the whole community. Through the specific role of the formators and, in a special way, the Spiritual Director, a pedagogical itinerary is proposed, which sustains the candidate in the process of growth, helping him to become aware of his own poverty and, at the same time, of his need for the grace of God and fraternal correction.</p>
        <p id="66"><span class="sectionnumber">§66 </span>The duration of this stage, which must not be less than two years, should be sufficient to attain its own proper objectives and, at the same time, to acquire the necessary knowledge of philosophy and of the human sciences. It must be valued properly in its own right and understood with regard to its specific aims, and not simply as an ‘obligatory step’ needed to reach theological studies.</p>
        <p id="67"><span class="sectionnumber">§67 </span>At the end of the stage of philosophical studies, or discipleship, having reached an adequate inner freedom and maturity, the seminarian should be possessed of the means necessary to begin that journey, with serenity and joy. This will lead him to a greater configuration to Christ in the vocation to ordained ministry. Indeed, after this stage, it will be possible to admit the seminarian among the candidates for Orders (<i>petitio</i> or candidacy, etc.), when it is deemed that his intention, marked by the required qualities, has reached sufficient maturity.<span class="footnumber">(97)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. PAUL VI, Apostolic Letter <i>Ad Pascendum</i> (15 August 1972), I, a) and c): <i>AAS</i> 64 (1972), 538-539.</span> For her part, in accepting the seminarian who offers himself, the Church chooses him and calls him so that he may prepare to receive Holy Orders in the future. Since it presupposes a responsible decision on the part of the seminarian, admission among the candidates for Orders is an invitation for him to continue with his formation, in configuring himself to Christ the Shepherd, through a formal recognition on the part of the Church.</p>
      </div> <button type="button" class="collapsible title3">a3) The Stage of Theological Studies (or Configuration)</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p id="68"><span class="sectionnumber">§68 </span><i>The concept of configuration</i>. The whole life of a priest, from the first moment of his calling, is, as already stated, one of continuous formation. It is the life of a disciple of Jesus, docile to the action of the Holy Spirit, for the service of the Church. The pedagogy of initial formation, in the first years in Seminary, was aimed above all at leading the candidate to enter into the <i>sequela Christi</i>. At the conclusion of that stage, the so-called discipleship stage, formation then concentrates on the configuration of the seminarian to Christ, Shepherd and Servant, so that, united to Him, he can make his life a gift of self to others.</p>
        <p>This configuration demands that the seminarian enter profoundly into the contemplation of the person of Jesus Christ, the beloved Son of the Father, sent as Shepherd of the People of God. It will make the relationship with Christ more intimate and personal and, at the same time, will lead to an awareness and an assumption of priestly identity.</p>
        <p id="69"><span class="sectionnumber">§69 </span>The stage of theological studies, or of configuration, is aimed above all at the spiritual formation proper to the priest. Gradual configuration to Christ becomes an experience which causes the sentiments and attitudes of the Son of God to arise in the life of the disciple. At the same time, it introduces the seminarian to an appreciation of the life of a priest, inspired by the desire and sustained by the capacity to offer himself for the pastoral care of the People of God. This stage allows the gradual grounding of the seminarian in the likeness of the Good Shepherd, who knows his sheep, gives his life for them<span class="footnumber">(98)</span><span class="footnote"><i>Directory for the Ministry and Life of Priests</i>, n. 8: <i>"It can therefore be said that the configuration to Christ through sacramental consecration defines the priest within the People of God, making him participate in his own way in the sanctifying, magisterial and pastoral power of Jesus Christ himself, Head and Pastor of the Church. Becoming increasingly like unto Christ, the priest is – thanks to Him, and to himself – a coworker in the salvation of his brethren: it is no longer he who loves and exists, but Christ in him (cf. Gal 2:20)".</i></span> and seeks out the ones that have wandered from the fold (cf. Jn 10:14-17).</p>
        <p>The content of this stage is demanding and requires a great deal of commitment. It asks for a constant responsibility in living the cardinal and theological virtues and the evangelical counsels.<span class="footnumber">(99)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, n. 27: <i>AAS</i> 84 (1992), 710.</span> It demands a docility to the action of God through the promptings of Holy Spirit, according to an authentically priestly and missionary mindset. It also calls for a gradual rereading of one’s own personal history in the light of pastoral charity, which animates, forms and motivates the life of the priest.<span class="footnumber">(100)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, n. 23: <i>AAS</i> 84 (1992), 691-694.</span></p>
        <p id="70"><span class="sectionnumber">§70 </span>The special commitment that characterises configuration to Christ, Servant and Shepherd, can correspond to the theological stage, without this necessarily exhausting its dynamism or its content. Concretely, a fruitful and harmonious interaction should be achieved between human and spiritual maturity, between the life of prayer and theological understanding.</p>
        <p id="71"><span class="sectionnumber">§71 </span>With a view to service in a particular Church, seminarians are called to acquire the spirituality of a diocesan priest, which is characterised by selfless dedication to the ecclesiastical circumscription to which they belong, or to the one in which they will in fact exercise the ministry, for the diocesan priest is the shepherd and servant of all in a specific context (cf. 1Cor 9:19). As a bond with the local Church, belonging to a Diocese specifically concerns the secular clergy, but it also pertains to all the priests who exercise the ministry there, without prejudice to the proper charism of each. This also means conforming one’s own way of thinking and working in communion with the Bishop and brother priests, for the good of a portion of the People of God.<span class="footnumber">(101)</span><span class="footnote">FRANCIS, <i>Address to the Priests of the Diocese of Caserta</i> (26 July 2014): <i>L'Osservatore Romano</i> 171 (28-29 July 2014), 5: "<i>the spirituality of the diocesan priest is to be open to diocesan life [...] It means a relationship with the Bishop, which must be realized and must grow continuously [...] Secondly, the diocesan life involves a relationship with the other priests, with all the presbytery. There is no spirituality of the diocesan priest without these two relationships: with the Bishop and with the presbyter. And they are needed."</i></span></p>
        <p>This indispensable love for the Diocese can be enriched by other charisms, brought about by the action of the Holy Spirit. In the same way, the gift of priesthood received in Holy Orders, includes a commitment to the Universal Church and, because of that, it is open to the mission of salvation addressed to all people, even to the ends of the earth (cf. Acts 1:8).<span class="footnumber">(102)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. <i>Presbyterorum Ordinis</i>, n. 10: <i>AAS</i> 58 (1966), 1007-1008; <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, n. 17: <i>AAS</i> 84 (1992), 682-684.</span></p>
        <p id="72"><span class="sectionnumber">§72 </span>During this stage, the ministries of lector and acolyte will be conferred upon seminarians, according to the maturing of each individual candidate and at an appropriate moment in the formation programme. They will then be able to exercise these ministries for a suitable period of time, and prepare themselves better for their future service of Word and Altar.<span class="footnumber">(103)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. PAUL VI, Apostolic Letter <i>Ministeria Quaedam</i> (15 August 1972), V-VI: <i>AAS</i> 64 (1972), 532-533.</span> Lectorate ‘challenges’ the seminarian to allow himself to be transformed by the Word of God, the object of his prayer and study. The conferral of the ministry of acolyte implies a deeper participation in the mystery of Christ, who gives Himself and is present in the Eucharist, in the assembly and in His brothers and sisters. </p>
        <p>For these reasons, the two ministries, accompanied by a suitable spiritual preparation, allow the demands of the <i>configuration stage</i> to be lived more intensely. During this stage, therefore, it is fitting for lectors and acolytes to be offered concrete ways of exercising the ministries received, not only in the liturgical environment, but also in catechesis, evangelisation, and the service of their neighbour.</p>
        <p>In any case, the right kind of accompaniment may reveal that the call which the young man believed that he had received, although recognised during the first stage, was not truly a vocation to the ministerial priesthood. Alternatively, it may not have been cultivated sufficiently. In either case, the seminarian should interrupt the journey of formation towards priestly ordination, either on his own initiative or following an authoritative intervention on the part of the formators.</p>
        <p id="73"><span class="sectionnumber">§73 </span>The stage of theological studies, or of configuration, is nevertheless oriented towards the conferral of Holy Orders. At the conclusion of this stage, or during the following one, if he has been judged suitable by the Bishop, after having heard the formators, the seminarian will petition to receive diaconal ordination. With diaconal ordination he will enter the clerical state, with its associated rights and duties, and will be incardinated “<i>either in a particular Church or personal prelature, or in an institute of consecrated life or society</i>”,<span class="footnumber">(104)</span><span class="footnote">CIC, can 265.</span> or in an Association or Ordinariate with the faculty to incardinate.</p>
      </div> <button type="button" class="collapsible title3">a4) The Pastoral Stage (or Vocational Synthesis)</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p id="74"><span class="sectionnumber">§74 </span>The pastoral stage, or vocational synthesis, is the time from leaving the Seminary until the subsequent priestly ordination, which obviously is brought about by conferral of the diaconate. This stage has a twofold purpose: on the one hand it is about being inducted into the pastoral life, with a gradual assumption of responsibilities in a spirit of service; on the other hand it is about making an suitable preparation, with the help of a specific accompaniment, in view of priesthood. During this stage, the candidate is asked to declare freely, consciously and definitively his intention to be a priest, having received diaconal ordination.<span class="footnumber">(105)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. <i>Optatam Totius</i>, n. 12: <i>AAS</i> 58 (1966), 721.</span></p>
        <p id="75"><span class="sectionnumber">§75 </span>In this regard, there are a great variety of experiences in the particular Churches, and it belongs to the Conferences of Bishops to determine the formative programmes in preparation for diaconal and priestly ordination. This stage will normally take place outside of the Seminary building, at least for a significant period of time. This period, which will normally be lived in the service of a community, can make a great impact on the personality of the candidate. Consequently, it is recommended that the Pastor [<i>parochus</i>], or whichever person is responsible for the pastoral setting that receives the seminarian, should be aware of the formative task entrusted to him, and should accompany him in his gradual entry to pastoral ministry.</p>
        <p id="76"><span class="sectionnumber">§76 </span>The Ordinary, by mutual agreement with the Rector of the Seminary where the seminarian has received his formation, and taking account of the needs of the presbyterate and the opportunities for formation available, shall assign each seminarian to a community where he will offer his pastoral service.<span class="footnumber">(106)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. <i>Optatam Totius</i>, n. 21: <i>AAS</i> 58 (1966), 726.</span> The duration of this stage of formation varies, and depends on the maturity and suitability of the candidate. Nonetheless, at least the times canonically established between the reception of the diaconate and of the presbyterate must be respected.<span class="footnumber">(107)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. CIC, can. 1031, §1 and 1032, §2.</span></p>
        <p id="77"><span class="sectionnumber">§77 </span><i>Diaconal and presbyteral ordination</i>. At the conclusion of the cycle of Seminary formation, the formators must help the candidate to accept with docility the decision the Bishop has made in his regard.<span class="footnumber">(108)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. BENEDICT XVI, Post-Synodal Apostolic Exhortation <i>Sacramentum Caritatis</i> (22 February 2007), n. 25: <i>AAS</i> 99 (2007), 125-126.</span></p>
        <p>Those who receive Holy Orders need a suitable time of preparation, especially of a spiritual nature.<span class="footnumber">(109)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. CIC, can. 1039.</span> A spirit of prayer, founded on a relationship with the person of Jesus, and an encounter with exemplary models of priesthood, should accompany an attentive reflection on the ordination rites which, in the prayers and liturgical actions, synthesise and express the profound meaning of the sacrament of Orders in the Church.</p>
        <p id="78"><span class="sectionnumber">§78 </span>The family of the candidate and the whole parish community should also experience an intense period of preparation. The specific formative programmes for diaconate and for priesthood, however, should be clearly distinguished, since they are two very different moments. Thus, unless serious reasons suggest otherwise, it will not be preferable to join in one celebration both diaconal ordination (transitional or permanent) and presbyteral ordination, so as to give each moment the attention it deserves, and to help the understanding of the faithful.</p>
        <p id="79"><span class="sectionnumber">§79 </span><i>Connection to ongoing formation</i>.

    <div class="content">
      <p id="80"><span class="sectionnumber">§80 </span>The term ‘ongoing formation’<span class="footnumber">(111)</span><span class="footnote">Over the course of time, the concept of ongoing formation has been deepened both in society and in the Church. An important moment in this process was the 'Letter to Priests' (especially no. 10) issued by John Paul II on 8 April 1979: <i>Insegnamenti</i> II (1979), 857-859: "<i>we must all be converted anew every day. We know that this is a fundamental exigency of the Gospel, addressed to everyone (cf. Mt 4:17; Mk 1:15), and all the more do we have to consider it as addressed to us [...] We must link prayer with continuous work upon ourselves: this is the formatio permanens [...] this formation must be both interior, that is to say directed towards the deepening of the priest's spiritual life, and must also be pastoral and intellectual (philosophical and theological)".</i> For a general overview and synthesis on this point, see <i>General Directory for the Ministry and Life of Priests</i>, nn. 87-115.</span> is a reminder that the one experience of discipleship of those called to priesthood is never interrupted. The priest not only ‘learns to know Christ’ but, under the action of the Holy Spirit, he finds himself within a process of gradual and continuous configuration to Him, in his being and his acting, which constantly challenges the person to inner growth.<span class="footnumber">(112)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. FRANCIS, <i>Address to the Plenary of the Congregation for the Clergy</i> (3 October 2014): <i>L'Osservatore Romano</i> 226 (4 October 2014), 8.</span></p>
      <p>One must constantly feed the ‘fire’ that gives light and warmth to the exercise of the ministry, remembering that, “<i>the heart and form of the priest’s ongoing formation is pastoral charity</i>’.<span class="footnumber">(113)</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, n. 70: <i>AAS</i> 84 (1992), 781.</span></p>
      <p id="81"><span class="sectionnumber">§81 </span>Ongoing formation is intended to ensure fidelity to the priestly ministry in a continuing journey of conversion, in order to rekindle the gift received at ordination.<span class="footnumber">(114)</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, n. 70: <i>AAS</i> 84 (1992), 781.</span> This journey is the natural continuation of the process of building up priestly identity begun in Seminary and accomplished sacramentally in priestly ordination, in view of a pastoral service that causes it to mature over time.<span class="footnumber">(115)</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, n. 71: <i>AAS</i> 84 (1992), 782-783.</span></p>
      <p id="82"><span class="sectionnumber">§82 </span>It is important that the faithful should be able to encounter priests who are suitably mature and formed. Indeed, “<i>corresponding to this serious duty is a precise right on the part of the faithful, who positively feel the effects of the good formation and holiness of their priests</i>”.<span class="footnumber">(116)</span><span class="footnote"><i>Directory for the Ministry and Life of Priests</i>, n. 87.</span> Ongoing formation must be concrete, that is to say incarnate in priestly reality, so that all priests can undertake it effectively; after all, it is the priest himself who is principally and primarily responsible for his own ongoing formation.<span class="footnumber">(117)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, n. 79: <i>AAS</i> 84 (1992), 796.</span></p>
      <p>Priestly fraternity is the first setting in which ongoing formation is takes place. It is desirable that this formation be promoted in each Diocese by a priest or group of priests, specifically prepared for it and officially appointed to assist in ongoing formation. The different age groups and particular circumstances of the brethren should be taken into consideration.<span class="footnumber">(118)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. <i>Directory for the Ministry and Life of Priests</i>i>, n. 108.</span></p>
      <p id="83"><span class="sectionnumber">§83 </span>The first phase of this journey corresponds to the years immediately after priestly ordination. In this period, the priest acquires, through the exercise of the ministry, fidelity to the personal encounter with the Lord and to his own spiritual accompaniment, along with the openness to asking the advice of priests with more experience. Particularly significant is the capacity to establish relationships of cooperation and sharing with other priests of the same generation. It is desirable that accompaniment by confreres of exemplary life and pastoral zeal be promoted, so that they can help young priests to experience a cordial and active participation in the life of the entire diocesan presbyterate.</p>
      <p>It is the Bishop’s responsibility to “<i>to ensure that newly ordained priests are not immersed in excessively burdensome or delicate situations, and that they are not assigned to destinations where they would be working far away from their confreres. In fact, it will be good to foster some opportune form of common life insofar as possible</i>”.<span class="footnumber">(119)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. <i>Directory for the Ministry and Life of Priests</i>, n. 100.</span> It is good to set up a system of personal accompaniment of young priests, to promote and maintain the quality of their ministry, so that they can embrace their first pastoral challenges with enthusiasm. It is the Pastor [<i>parochus</i>] above all who should assume responsibility for this, or whichever priest it is to whom the young priest has first been sent.</p>
      <p id="84"><span class="sectionnumber">§84 </span>After some years of pastoral experience, new challenges for the ministry and life of the priest can easily emerge:
      <ol type="a">
        <li><i>The experience of one’s own weakness</i>: conflicts that may remain in his personality can emerge and these need to be addressed. The experience of his own weakness can lead the priest to a greater humility and trust in the merciful action of the Lord – whose “strength is shown most fully in weakness” (cf. 2Cor 12:9) – as well as a generous understanding of others. The priest must not become isolated. Instead he should be supported and accompanied in spiritual and/or psychological areas. In every case, his relationship with his Spiritual Director will need to be deepened so as to draw positive lessons from the difficulties, learning to look truthfully at his own life and to understand it better in the light of the Gospel.</li>
        <li><i>The risk of thinking of oneself simply as a dispenser of sacred things</i>: with the passage of time, the priest can acquire the idea that he is a mere community worker or a dispenser of sacred things,<span class="footnumber">(120)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, n. 72: <i>AAS</i> 84 (1992), 783-787.</span> without the heart of a shepherd. As soon as he notices this, it will be important for the priest to sense the closeness of his confreres and to draw closer to them. Indeed, as Pope Francis has remarked, “<i>there is no need for […] functionary priests who, while playing a role, seek their consolation far from Him. Only one whose gaze is fixed on what is truly essential can renew his ‘yes’ to the gift received and, in life’s various seasons, does not cease to make a gift of himself; only one who lets himself be conformed to the Good Shepherd finds unity, peace and strength in the obedience of service…</i>”.<span class="footnumber">(121)</span><span class="footnote">FRANCIS, <i>Letter to Participants in the Extraordinary General Assembly of the Italian Episcopal Conference</i> (8 November 2014): <i>L'Osservatore Romano</i> 258 (12 November 2014), 7: cf. <i>Presbyterorum Ordinis</i>, n. 14: <i>AAS</i> 58 (1966), 1013-1014.</span></li>
        <li><i>The challenge of contemporary culture</i>: the appropriate involvement of the priestly ministry in the culture of today, with all the complex problems that it brings in its wake, requires openness in priests and that they remain up to date.<span class="footnumber">(122)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, n. 78: <i>AAS</i> 84 (1992), 795-796.</span> Above all, it requires that they remain firmly anchored to the four dimensions of formation: human, spiritual, intellectual and pastoral. </li>
        <li><i>The allure of power and riches</i>: this may take the form of attachment to a position, obsession with marking out space exclusively for oneself, careerism, emergence of hunger for power or the desire for wealth, with the consequent lack of openness to the will of God, to the needs of the people entrusted to his care, or to the requests of the Bishop. Fraternal correction may help in such circumstances, or even a reproof or some other approach suggested by pastoral concern, unless the behaviour constitutes a delict that calls for the imposition of penalties.</li>
        <li><i>The challenge of celibacy</i>: how to live celibacy for the Kingdom in a context where new stimuli and the tensions of pastoral life, instead of assisting the growth and maturing of the person, can lead to emotional regression. Influenced by strong social pressures, this can lead to giving undue priority to one’s own needs and seeking out forms of compensatory behaviour, thus hampering priestly fatherhood and pastoral charity. </li>
        <li><i>Total dedication to one’s ministry</i>: with the passage of time, tiredness, natural physical weaknesses, and the first manifestations of frail health, conflicts, disappointments over pastoral expectations, the burden of routine, the fatigue induced by change, and other socio-cultural elements can dampen apostolic zeal and generosity in giving oneself to the pastoral ministry. </li>

      <p id="85"><span class="sectionnumber">§85 </span>At any age, a priest may require help due to some infirmity. Elderly and ailing priests offer to the Christian community, and to the presbyterate, their own witness and are an effective and eloquent sign of a life given to the Lord. It is important that they continue to feel themselves an active part of the presbyterate and of diocesan life, especially through frequent visits from and the solicitous closeness of their confreres. </p>
      <p id="86"><span class="sectionnumber">§86 </span>Initiatives for the support of priests, born out of a concern for priests who are exercising the ministry in the same geographical area, in the same pastoral environment, or who are involved in the same project, are also praiseworthy. </p>
      <p id="87"><span class="sectionnumber">§87 </span>Sacramental fraternity is a valuable help for the ongoing formation of priests. Indeed, the journey of discipleship requires constant growth in charity, which is the synthesis of “<i>priestly perfection</i>”.<span class="footnumber">(123)</span><span class="footnote"><i>Presbyterorum Ordinis</i>, n. 14: <i>AAS</i> 58 (1966), 1013.</span> However, this cannot be achieved in isolation, since priests form one presbyterate whose unity is made up of “<i>special bonds of apostolic charity, ministry and brotherhood</i>”.<span class="footnumber">(124)</span><span class="footnote"><i>Presbyterorum Ordinis</i>, n. 8: <i>AAS</i> 58 (1966), 1004.</span> Thus, the “<i>intimate sacramental fraternity</i>”<span class="footnumber">(125)</span><span class="footnote"><i>Presbyterorum Ordinis</i>, n. 8: <i>AAS</i> 58 (1966), 1003.</span> of priests is the first manifestation of charity, as well as the first place in which it can grow. All this can be achieved by the help of the Holy Spirit, and not without a personal spiritual struggle, to purify oneself of all forms of individualism.</p>
      <p id="88"><span class="sectionnumber">§88 </span>Among those ways that can give concrete expression to sacramental fraternity, some in particular should be encouraged from the time of initial formation:
      <ol type="a">
        <li><i>Fraternal meetings</i>: some priests organise fraternal meetings for prayer, perhaps by reading the Word of God together in the form of <i>Lectio Divina</i>, developing their understanding of some theological or pastoral theme, sharing a ministerial endeavour, helping one another or simply spending some time together. These meetings in their various forms are the simplest and most common expression of priestly fraternity. In any case, it is strongly desirable to promote them. </li>
        <li><i>Spiritual Direction and confession</i>: sacramental fraternity becomes a particularly valuable help when it takes the form of <i>spiritual direction</i> and confession, which priests ask one another to provide. Maintaining a regular schedule in this type of meeting helps to keep alive the “<i>striving for spiritual perfection on which, above all, the effectiveness of their ministry depends</i>”.<span class="footnumber">(126)</span><span class="footnote">BENEDICT XVI, <i>Address to Participants in the Plenary of the Congregation for the Clergy</i> (16 March 2009): <i>Insegnamenti</i> V/1 (2009), 392.</span> It is particularly in moments of difficulty that priests will find in their Spiritual Director a brother, who can help them to discern the source of their difficulties, and put adequate means in place to address them.</li>
        <li><i>Retreats</i>: these are of fundamental importance in the life of the priest, since they lead to a personal encounter with the Lord in silence and recollection. They are a privileged time of personal and apostolic discernment, for a gradual and profound review of one’s life. When offered as a group experience for priests, they can favour a wider participation and the strengthening of fraternal communion.</li>
        <li><i>A common table</i>: when they share meals, priests come to know one another, to listen to and to appreciate one another. This also gives them the opportunity for worthwhile friendly exchanges.</li>
        <li><i>Common Life</i>: some priests share a common life as a personal initiative, out of pastoral necessity, or through custom or local arrangements.<span class="footnumber">(127)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. CIC, can. 280; <i>Directory for the Ministry and Life of Priests</i>, n. 38.</span> Sharing the same house becomes a true ‘common life’ through community prayer, meditation on the Word of God and other opportunities for ongoing formation. Moreover, this arrangement allows for a sharing of ideas about pastoral endeavours of each priest. A common life also seeks to support the emotional and spiritual balance of those involved, and can encourage communion with the Bishop. It will be necessary to ensure that forms of common life remain open to the entire presbyterate and to the pastoral needs of the Diocese.</li>
        <li><i>Priestly Associations</i>: these are meant to encourage the unity of the priests among themselves, with the rest of the presbyterate and with the Bishop.<span class="footnumber">(128)</span><span class="footnote">Cf.

      <p id="89"><span class="sectionnumber">§89 </span>According to the Apostolic Exhortation <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>,<span class="footnumber">(131)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, n. 43-59: <i>AAS</i> 84 (1992), 731-762.</span> there are four dimensions that interact simultaneously in the iter of formation and in the life of ordained ministers: the human dimension, which represents the ‘necessary and dynamic foundation’ of all priestly life; the spiritual dimension, which helps to shape the quality of priestly ministry; the intellectual dimension, which provides the rational tools needed in order to understand the values that belong to being a pastor, to make them incarnate in daily life, and to transmit the content of the faith appropriately; the pastoral dimension, which makes possible a responsible and fruitful ecclesial service. </p>
      <p>Each of the dimensions of formation is aimed at ‘transforming’ or ‘assimilating’ the heart in the image of the heart of Christ,<span class="footnumber">(132)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. <i>Optatam Totius</i>, n. 4: <i>AAS</i> 58 (1966), 716; <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, n. 57: <i>AAS</i> 84 (1992), 757-759.</span> who was sent by the Father to fulfil his loving plan.

As the Second Vatican Council indicates,<span class="footnumber">(133)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. <i>Optatam Totius</i>, nn. 4 and 19: <i>AAS</i> 58 (1966), 716 and 725-726.</span> the entire process of formation in preparation for priestly ministry, in fact, has as its aim the preparation of seminarians to “<i>enter into communion with the charity of Christ the Good Shepherd</i>”.<span class="footnumber">(134)</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, n. 57: <i>AAS</i> 84 (1992), 757-758.</span></p>
      <p id="90"><span class="sectionnumber">§90 </span>By the sacrament of Orders, the seminarian will be called to gather into one and to preside over the People of God, as a leader who supports and promotes the cooperation of all the faithful. Priestly formation must therefore take place within an atmosphere of community, which is able to encourage those attitudes that are proper and of practical value for the life and ministry of a priest.<span class="footnumber">(135)</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, n. 65: <i>AAS</i> 84 (1992), 770: "<i>the Church as such is the communal subject which has the grace and responsibility to accompany those whome the Lord calls to become his ministers in the priesthood".</i></span></p>
      <p>Community life in the Seminary is the most suitable context for preparing seminarians for true priestly fraternity. It is the environment in which the aforementioned dimensions come together and interact, and where they attain to mutual harmony and integration. Certain formative instruments should be adopted for community formation and for a better knowledge of the individual seminarians, such as: sincere and open communication, exchange, review of life, fraternal correction, and community programmes.</p>
      <p>The community forms the seedbed of a priestly vocation, since the seminarian emerges from it, in order to be sent back to serve it after ordination. The seminarian to begin with, and later the priest, must have a living bond with the community. It is the thread that binds together and harmonises the four dimensions of formation. </p>
      <p id="91"><span class="sectionnumber">§91 </span>The Christian community is brought together by the Spirit in order to be sent out on mission. Thus the missionary impulse and its concrete manifestation belong to the entire People of God,<span class="footnumber">(136)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. <i>Evangelii Gaudium</i>, nn. 119-121: <i>AAS</i> 105 (2013), 1069-1071.</span> which must always be “<i>going forth</i>”,<span class="footnumber">(137)</span><span class="footnote"><i>Evangelii Gaudium</i>, n. 20: <i>AAS</i> 105 (2013), 1028.</span> since “<i>the Gospel joy which enlivens the community of disciples is a missionary joy</i>”.<span class="footnumber">(138)</span><span class="footnote"><i>Evangelii Gaudium</i>, n. 21: <i>AAS</i> 105 (2013), 1028.</span> This missionary drive concerns those called to the ministerial priesthood even more particularly, as it is the goal and the horizon of all formation. Mission is another thread that binds (cf. Mk 3:13-14), animates and gives life to the dimensions already mentioned. It allows the priest, who has been formed humanly, intellectually, spiritually and pastorally, to live his ministry fully, since he is “<i>called to have a missionary spirit, that is to say a truly ‘catholic’ spirit, which, beginning from Christ, reaches out to all so that ‘they may be saved and reach full knowledge of the truth’ (1Tm 2:4)</i>”.<span class="footnumber">(139)</span><span class="footnote"><i>Directory for the Ministry and Life of Priests</i>, n. 16.</span></p>
      <p id="92"><span class="sectionnumber">§92 </span>The concept of integral formation is of the greatest importance, since it is the whole person, with all that he is and all that he possesses, who will be at the Lord’s service in the Christian community. The one called is an ‘integral subject’, namely someone who has been previously chosen to attain a sound interior life, without divisions or contradictions. It is necessary to adopt an integrated pedagogical model in order to reach this objective: a journey that allows the formative community to cooperate with the action of the Holy Spirit, ensuring a proper balance between the different dimensions of formation.</p>
      <p>For this reason, it is necessary to be vigilant, lest overly simplistic or erroneous visions of the priesthood should find their way into the iter of formation. Formators should be attentive in discerning whether there is a merely formal and external respect given to the formation demands placed upon those entrusted to their care. Such an attitude would not help their integral growth but rather would make them accustomed, more or less unconsciously, to a purely ‘servile and self-serving’ obedience.</p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible title2">b) The Human Dimension</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p id="93"><span class="sectionnumber">§93 </span>The divine call engages and involves the ‘concrete’ human person. Formation for the priesthood must necessarily provide adequate means to allow for maturation in view of an authentic exercise of the priestly ministry. To that end, the seminarian is called upon to develop his personality, having Christ, the perfect man, as his model and source.</p>
      <p>The criteria of suitability for ordained ministers received ample reflection in the New Testament.<span class="footnumber">(140)</span><span class="footnote">For example, cf. Mt 28:20; 1Pt 5:1-4; Tit 1:5-9.</span> This illustrates the extent to which aspects relating to the human dimension were highlighted from the very beginning. The Church Fathers developed and practised the care or ‘therapy’ of the man of faith called to apostolic service, for they were convinced of the profound need for maturation that remains in everyone.<span class="footnumber">(141)</span><span class="footnote">For example, one can think of GREGORY NAZIANZEN, <i>Oratio II</i>: PG 35, 27.</span> A correct and harmonious spirituality demands a well-structured humanity; indeed, as St. Thomas Aquinas reminds us, “<i>grace builds upon nature</i>”,<span class="footnumber">(142)</span><span class="footnote">THOMAS AQUINAS, <i>Summa Theologiae</i>, I, q. 2, a. 2 ad 1.</span> it does not supplant nature, but perfects it.<span class="footnumber">(143)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. <i>Summa Theologiae</i>, I, q. 1, a. 8 ad 2.</span> Therefore, it is necessary to cultivate humility, courage, common sense, magnanimity, right judgement and discretion, tolerance and transparency, love of truth and honesty.</p>
      <p id="94"><span class="sectionnumber">§94 </span>Human formation, being the foundation of all priestly formation,<span class="footnumber">(144)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, n. 43: <i>AAS</i> 84 (1992), 731-732.</span> promotes the integral growth of the person and allows the integration of all its dimensions. Physically, this means an interest in health, nutrition, physical activity, and rest; psychologically it focuses on the constitution of a stable personality, characterised by emotional balance, self-control and a well integrated sexuality. In the moral sphere, it is connected to the requirement that the individual arrive gradually at a well formed conscience. This means that he will become a responsible person able to make the right decisions, gifted with right judgement and able to have an objective perception of persons and events. Such a perspective should bring the seminarian to a balanced sense of self respect, leading him to be aware of his own talents and learning how to place them at the service of the People of God. The aesthetic sense should also be cultivated in human formation, by offering opportunities for an appreciation of various modes of artistic expression, cultivating in him the ‘sense of beauty’. He ought to be aware of the social environment, and be helped to improve his capacity for social interaction, so that he can contribute to building up the community in which he lives. </p>
      <p>In order for this training to be fruitful, it is important that every seminarian be aware of his own life history, and be ready to share it with his formators. This would include especially his experience of childhood and adolescence, the influence that his family and his relatives have exercised upon him, his ability to establish mature and well balanced interpersonal relationships, or his lack thereof, and his ability to handle positively moments of solitude. Such information will be helpful for choosing the most fitting pedagogical means, both for an assessment of the journey thus far and for a better understanding of any moments of regression or of difficulty.</p>
      <p id="95"><span class="sectionnumber">§95 </span>A sign of the harmonious development of the personality of seminarians is a mature capacity for relations with men and women of various ages and social conditions. It would be fitting to take into consideration the relationship between the seminarian and women, as addressed in Magisterial documents where we read that it affects “<i>the seminarian not only in the sphere of his personal life, but also with a view to his future pastoral activity</i>”.<span class="footnumber">(145)</span><span class="footnote"><i>A Guide to Formation in Priestly Celibacy</i>, n. 60.</span></p>
      <p>The first environment in which someone comes to be acquainted with and appreciate women is obviously within the family. The presence of a woman there accompanies the entire formative journey and constitutes, from infancy onwards, a positive contribution to integral growth. Another significant contribution comes from the various women who, by the witness of their lives, give an example of prayer and pastoral service, a spirit of sacrifice and self-denial, of care and tender closeness to their neighbour. A similar reflection could be made about the witness given by the presence of consecrated women.</p>
      <p>This understanding and this familiarity with the feminine, so present in parishes and many ecclesial contexts, are beneficial and essential to the human and spiritual formation of the seminarian, and should always be seen in a positive light. As John Paul II remarked: “<i>it is thus my hope […] that you will reflect carefully on what it means to speak of the ‘genius of women’, not only in order to be able to see in this phrase a specific part of God’s plan which needs to be accepted and appreciated, but also in order to let this genius be more fully expressed in the life of society as a whole, as well as in the life of the Church</i>”.<span class="footnumber">(146)</span><span class="footnote">JOHN PAUL II, <i>Letter to Women</i> (29 June 1995), n. 10: <i>Insegnamenti</i> XVIII/1 (1995), 1879; cf. <i>A Guide to Formation in Priestly Celibacy</i>, n. 29.</span></p>
      <p id="96"><span class="sectionnumber">§96 </span>The seminarian also becomes capable of self-determination and living with responsibility through an awareness of his own weakness, which is always present in his personality. Formators, confessors, spiritual directors and the seminarians themselves should be aware that moments of crisis, if adequately understood and addressed, with a willingness to learn from life, can and must become occasions of conversion and renewal. These moments will lead the seminarian to question himself critically about the journey so far, about his current condition, about his choices and about his future.</p>
      <p id="97"><span class="sectionnumber">§97 </span>Human formation is a necessary element for evangelisation, since the proclamation of the Gospel takes place through the person and is mediated by his humanity. “<i>You will be my witnesses […] to the ends of the earth</i>” (cf. Acts 1:8). Modern day reality obliges us to think about these words of Jesus in a new way, because “<i>the ends of the earth</i>” have expanded through the mass media and social networks. It is “<i>a new ‘agora’, an open public square in which people share ideas, information and opinions, and in which new relationships and forms of community can come into being</i>”,<span class="footnumber">(147)</span><span class="footnote">BENEDICT XVI, <i>Message for the XLVII World Communications Day</i> (12 May 2013): <i>AAS</i> 105 (2013), 181.</span> an arena from which the pastors of the future cannot remain aloof, either during their formation or their future ministry.</p>
      <p>From that point of view, the use of the media and ease with the digital world are an integral part of the development of the personality of the seminarian, because, “<i>using new communication technologies, priests can introduce people to the life of the Church and help our contemporaries to discover the face of Christ. They will best achieve this aim if they learn, from the time of their formation, how to use these technologies in a competent and appropriate way, shaped by sound theological insights and reflecting a strong priestly spirituality grounded in constant dialogue with the Lord</i>”.<span class="footnumber">(148)</span><span class="footnote">ID., <i>Message for the XLIV World Communications Day</i> (16 May 2010): <i>AAS</i> 1032 (2010), 115-116.</span></p>
      <p id="98"><span class="sectionnumber">§98 </span>The Church, in virtue of the mandate received from Christ, looks confidently at the possibilities offered by the digital world for evangelisation.<span class="footnumber">(149)</span><span class="footnote">FRANCIS, <i>Message for the XLVIII World Communications Day</i> (1 June 2014): <i>AAS</i> 106 (2014), 115: <i>"Keeping the doors of our churches open also means keeping them open in the digital environment so that people, whatever their situation in life, can enter, and so that the Gospel can go out to reach everyone".</i></span> There are new ‘places’ through which many are moving daily, ‘digital peripheries’ which should not be deprived of the possibility of an authentic culture of encounter in the name of Jesus, to build up one People of God: “<i>the media can help us to feel closer to one another, creating a sense of the unity of the human family which can in turn inspire solidarity and serious efforts to ensure a more dignified life for all. Good communication helps us to grow closer, to know one another better, and ultimately, to grow in unity</i>”.<span class="footnumber">(150)</span><span class="footnote">FRANCIS, <i>Message for the XLVIII World Communications Day</i> (1 June 2014): <i>AAS</i> 106 (2014), 113.</span></p>
      <p id="99"><span class="sectionnumber">§99 </span>Those who begin the Seminary journey are, for the most part, already naturally quite adept and immersed in the digital world and its instruments. It is necessary to pay prudent attention to the inevitable risks that come with frequenting the digital world, including various forms of addiction, which can be addressed with suitable spiritual and psychological supports. It is fitting for seminarians to grow in this context, keeping in mind that the Seminary is a school of humanity and faith, so that their conformation to Christ can grow. He brings Himself close to all humanity, even those who are far off: “<i>may the image of the Good Samaritan who tended to the wounds of the injured man by pouring oil and wine over them be our inspiration. Let our communication be a balm which relieves pain and a fine wine which gladdens hearts. May the light we bring to others not be the result of cosmetics or special effects, but rather of our being loving and merciful ‘neighbours’ to those wounded and left on the side of the road</i>”.<span class="footnumber">(151)</span><span class="footnote">FRANCIS, <i>Message for the XLVIII World Communications Day</i> (1 June 2014): <i>AAS</i> 106 (2014), 116.</span></p>
      <p id="100"><span class="sectionnumber">§100 </span>Social networks should be integrated into the daily life of the Seminary community in a particular way (by a use that is vigilant, but also serene and positive). They should be experienced as places that offer new possibilities from the point of view of interpersonal relationships, of encounter with others, of engagement with one’s neighbour, of the witness of faith. These may all be viewed from the perspective of formative growth, which cannot fail to take into consideration every place in which relationships are formed and in which we find ourselves living.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <p id="116"><span class="sectionnumber">§116 </span>Intellectual formation is aimed at achieving for seminarians a solid competence in philosophy and theology, along with a more general educational preparation, enough to allow them to proclaim the Gospel message to the people of our own day in a way that is credible and can be understood. It seeks to enable them to enter into fruitful dialogue with the contemporary world, and to uphold the truth of the faith by the light of reason, thereby revealing its beauty.</p>
      <p>Candidates for the priesthood must prepare themselves with diligent attention, by deepening their knowledge of the philosophical and theological sciences, with a good introduction to canon law, social sciences, and history. This preparation seeks to ‘give a reason for hope’ (cf. 1Pt 3:15), to allow Divine Revelation to become known, and to bring all peoples to the obedience of faith (cf. Rom 16:26).</p>
      <p>Reason, when open to the mystery of God and directed to Him, allows a solid acceptance of Revelation, seeks a deeper understanding of its contents, and offers instruments and language for its proclamation to the world. As already stated by the Second Vatican Council, the knowledge of philosophy and theology helps us “<i>to hear, distinguish and interpret the many voices of our age, and to judge them in the light of the divine word, so that revealed truth can always be more deeply penetrated, better understood and set forth to greater advantage</i>”.<span class="footnumber">(194)</span><span class="footnote"><i>Gaudium et Spes</i>, n. 44: <i>AAS</i> 58 (1966), 1065.</span></p>
      <p id="117"><span class="sectionnumber">§117 </span>Intellectual formation is a part of the integral formation of the priest. Moreover, it serves his pastoral ministry and has an impact upon his human and spiritual formation, which draw rich nourishment from it. This means that the development of all the faculties and dimensions of the person, including the rational dimension, through the vast array of acquired knowledge, contributes to the growth of the priest as the servant and witness of the Word in the Church and in the world. Far from being confined solely to the field of knowledge or being understood solely as a means of acquiring more information in the various disciplines, intellectual formation helps priests to listen profoundly to the Word, and also to the ecclesial community, in order to learn how to read the signs of the times. </p>
      <p id="118"><span class="sectionnumber">§118 </span>The organic and serious study of philosophy and theology is the most suitable means of acquiring that <i>forma mentis</i> that enables one to address the questions and challenges that are encountered in the exercise of the sacred ministry, and to interpret them in the light of faith.

    <button type="button" class="collapsible title2">e) The Pastoral Dimension</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p id="119"><span class="sectionnumber">§119 </span>Since the Seminary is intended to prepare seminarians to be shepherds in the image of Christ, priestly formation must be permeated by a pastoral spirit. It will make them able to demonstrate that same compassion, generosity, love for all, especially for the poor, and zeal for the Kingdom that characterised the public ministry of the Son of God. This can be summed up as pastoral charity.</p>
      <p>Naturally, however, a formation of a specifically pastoral character<span class="footnumber">(195)</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, n. 58: <i>AAS</i> 84 (1992), 759-760: "<i>The seminary which educates must seek really and truly to initiate the candidate into the sensitivity of being a shepherd, in the conscious and mature assumption of his responsibilities, in the interior habit of evaluating problems and establishing priorities and looking for solutions on the basis of honest motivations of faith and according to the theological demands inherent in pastoral work"</i>; CIC, can. 258.</span> must be provided. It should be such as to help the seminarian to acquire the inner freedom to live the apostolate as service, able to see the work of God in the hearts and lives of the people. Seen in this way, when he is an ordained minister, pastoral activity will take on the form of an ongoing school of evangelisation. In this time, the seminarian will begin to see himself as a group leader and to be present as a man of communion. He will do so by listening and careful discernment of situations, as well as cooperating with others and encouraging their ‘<i>ministeriality</i>’. In a particular way, seminarians must be duly prepared to work together with permanent deacons and with the world of the laity, appreciating their particular contribution. It is also necessary for candidates for the ministerial priesthood to receive a suitable formation on the evangelical nature of consecrated life in its varied expressions, on the charism that is proper to it and on its canonical aspects, the better to ensure fruitful collaboration.</p>
      <p id="120"><span class="sectionnumber">§120 </span>The call to be pastors of the People of God requires a formation that makes future priests experts in the art of pastoral discernment, that is to say, able to listen deeply to real situations and capable of good judgement in making choices and decisions. To make pastoral discernment effective, the evangelical style of listening must take central place. This frees the pastor from the temptation to abstraction, to self-promotion, to excessive self-assurance, and to that aloofness, that would make him a ‘<i>spiritual accountant</i>’ instead of a ‘<i>good Samaritan</i>’.<span class="footnumber">(196)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. <i>Evangelii Gaudium</i>, n. 33: <i>AAS</i> 105 (2013), 1034; <i>Amoris Laetitia</i>, n. 300; FRANCIS, <i>Homily for the Jubilee of Priests and Seminarians</i> (3 June 2016), <i>L'Osservatore Romano</i> 126 (4 June 2016), 8.</span> He who sets himself to listen to God and to his brothers and sisters knows that it is the Spirit who guides the Church towards the fullness of truth (cf. Jn 16:13). He also knows that, in keeping with the mystery of the Incarnation, this fullness of truth sprouts gradually in the real life of a human being and in the signs of history.</p>
      <p>In this way, the pastor will learn to leave behind his preconceived certainties, and will not think of his ministry as a series of things to be done or norms to be applied, but will make his life a ‘place’ for listening openly to God and to his brothers and sisters.<span class="footnumber">(197)</span><span class="footnote">FRANCIS, <i>Angelus</i> (17 July 2016): <i>L'Osservatore Romano</i> 163 (18-19 July 2016), 1: "<i>A guest is not merely to be served, fed, looked after in every way. Most importantly he ought to be listened to [...] A guest should be welcomed as a person, with a story, his heart rich with feelings and thoughts, so that he may truly feel like he is among family</i>".</span></p>
      <p>In listening closely, respectfully and without prejudice, the pastor becomes able to read the lives of others without being superficial or judgemental. He enters into the heart of the person and into the contexts of life that distinguish him, above all into the internal and external obstacles that can, at times, produce problematic behaviour. He will be able to interpret with wisdom and understanding all kinds of things that condition people and influence their lives. He learns how to offer spiritual and pastoral possibilities that are attainable, and that respond to the life of the faithful and the socio-cultural context in which they are found. </p>
      <p>The gaze of the Good Shepherd, who seeks out, walks alongside and leads his sheep, will form a serene, prudent and compassionate outlook in him. He will exercise his ministry with a disposition of serene openness and attentive accompaniment in all situations, even those that are most complex, showing the beauty and the demands of the Gospel truth, without falling into legalistic or rigorist obsessions. In this way he will know how to offer pathways of faith with little steps, that can more easily be understood and accepted. Hence he will become a sign of mercy and compassion, witnessing to the motherly face of the Church which, without diminishing the demands of the Gospel truth, avoids making millstones of them, leading rather with compassion and including all. </p>
      <p id="121"><span class="sectionnumber">§121 </span>Because pastoral care is also extended to the non-practising, non-believers, and those who profess another religion, seminarians should learn how to enter into dialogue and how to proclaim the Gospel of Christ to all, aware of their deepest expectations, and with respect for their freedom. Formators, therefore, should teach future priests to create new ‘spaces’ and new pastoral opportunities, to go out to meet those who do not fully share the Catholic faith, but who are nonetheless searching, with good will, for a comprehensive and authentic response to their deepest questions. </p>
      <p id="122"><span class="sectionnumber">§122 </span>A sound pastoral formation demands not only engaging in apostolic activities, but also the study of pastoral theology.

      <p>Seminarians ought to be moved by an authentically Catholic spirit.

Each Seminary, in coordination with other diocesan institutions and in close contact with them, should set out what will be expected of the pastoral placement, arranging it over the year in such a way that it does not clash with the other demands of formation. Much attention should be given to the settings in which the seminarians will carry out their pastoral placements.

Additionally, he is to coordinate the academic administrative office and is responsible for the library.</p>
      <p>When the seminarians undertake their studies in a University or Faculty, the ‘coordinator of intellectual formation’ is to take an interest in and follow their progress.

      <p>Among the formators, the ‘coordinator of pastoral formation” takes care of theoretical and practical pastoral formation. He identifies suitable locations for pastoral placements, and he organises apostolic experiences in dialogue with priests, religious and laity.</p>

      <p id="143"><span class="sectionnumber">§143 </span>The number of professors must be proportionate and adequate to the teaching needs and to the number of seminarians. It is preferable for the greater part of the teaching body to be composed of priests, who can also ensure a pastoral approach in their own subject, by drawing directly from their pastoral experience.

      <p>The contribution of members of Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, and also of the lay faithful, can be of value in certain circumstances.

The pastoral engagement of the Seminary with the families of seminarians ought to contribute to their Christian development.

      <p id="155"><span class="sectionnumber">§155 </span>Although the propaedeutic stage is prior to, and prepares for, the study of philosophy and theology, it emphasises not only the intellectual aspect, “<i>but also, and above all, the human and the spiritual</i>”;<span class="footnumber">(244)</span><span class="footnote"><i>The Propaedeutic Period</i>, III, n. 1.</span> “<i>in particular, it is important to achieve a proper balance between the human-spiritual and educational components, so as to avoid multiplying the study materials unnecessarily, to the detriment of properly religious and priestly formation</i>”.<span class="footnumber">(245)</span><span class="footnote"><i>The Propaedeutic Period</i>, III, n. 6.</span></p>
      <p id="156"><span class="sectionnumber">§156 </span>Regarding the materials to be addressed in the propaedeutic period, the situation of the particular Church and society in which the education is to take place must be taken into account.

    <div class="content">
      <p id="158"><span class="sectionnumber">§158 </span>The study of philosophy “<i>leads to a deeper understanding and interpretation of the person, and of the person’s freedom and relationships with the world and with God. A proper philosophical training is vital, not only because of the links between the great philosophical questions and the mysteries of salvation which are studied in theology under the guidance of the higher light of faith, but also vis-à-vis an extremely widespread cultural situation which emphasizes subjectivism as a criterion and measure of truth […] Nor must one underestimate the importance of philosophy as a guarantee of that ‘certainty of truth’ which is the only firm basis for a total giving of oneself to Jesus and to the Church</i>”.<span class="footnumber">(248)</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, n. 52: <i>AAS</i> 84 (1992), 750.</span></p>
      <p id="159"><span class="sectionnumber">§159 </span>Among the materials to be studied in the area of philosophy, systematic philosophy should be given particular importance, for it leads to a sound and coherent knowledge of man, of the world and of God, providing a wide synthesis of thought and perspectives. This formation must be based on the philosophical patrimony which is perennially valid, to which the great Christian philosophers bear witness. </p>
      <p>Contemporary philosophical speculation must also be taken into account – especially those aspects that exert a major influence in one’s own country – along with the progress of modern sciences, so that seminarians can be adequately prepared for dialogue with others, by being properly aware of the salient trends in society. Seminarians must be trained for the better integration of philosophical studies by being given a specific ‘philosophical methodology’. </p>
      <p id="160"><span class="sectionnumber">§160 </span>Sufficient space must be given to metaphysics in this period of formation, since “<i>The sapiential characteristic of philosophy implies its ‘genuinely metaphysical range, capable, that is, of transcending empirical data in order to attain something absolute, ultimate and foundational in its search for truth’, even if only gradually known through the course of history</i>”,<span class="footnumber">(249)</span><span class="footnote">CONGREGATION FOR CATHOLIC EDUCATION, <i>Decree on the Reform of Ecclesiastical Studies of Philosophy</i> (28 January 2011), n. 4: <i>AAS</i> 104 (2012), 219; cf. also SACRED CONGREGATION FOR CATHOLIC EDUCATION, Circular Letter <i>on the Study of Philosophy in Seminaries</i> (20 January 1972), <i>Enchiridion Vaticanum</i> 4 (1971-1973), nn. 1516-1556.</span> according to “<i>philosophy’s ‘original vocation’: the search for truth, and its sapiential and metaphysical characteristic</i>”.<span class="footnumber">(250)</span><span class="footnote"><i>Decree on the Reform of Ecclesiastical Studies of Philosophy</i>, n. 3: <i>AAS</i> 104 (2012), 219.</span> It will also be necessary to give attention to theodicy and cosmology, which provide a Christian vision of reality.</p>
      <p id="161"><span class="sectionnumber">§161 </span>The ‘history of philosophy’ must be taught diligently, so that the genesis and development of the most important themes become clear. The ‘history of philosophy’ is designed to instil an understanding of the continuity of human reflection and thought on the Absolute, on truth and on the possibility of knowing it. Philosophical studies also provide fertile soil for dialogue and encounter with non-believers.</p>
      <p id="162"><span class="sectionnumber">§162 </span>Other materials to be covered in this phase of studies are philosophical anthropology, logic, aesthetics, epistemology, ethics, political philosophy and the philosophy of religion. </p>
      <p id="163"><span class="sectionnumber">§163 </span>Due attention should be given to the human sciences, such as sociology, pedagogy, and psychology, in the aspects most relevant to formation for priestly ministry.

      <p id="164"><span class="sectionnumber">§164 </span>By this course of studies, it will be possible to enkindle in seminarians “<i>a love of rigorously searching for the truth and of maintaining and demonstrating it, together with an honest recognition of the limits of human knowledge</i>”, and to do so from a pastoral perspective, giving attention “<i>to the necessary connection between philosophy and the true problems of life</i>”.<span class="footnumber">(251)</span><span class="footnote"><i>Optatam Totius</i>, n. 15: <i>AAS</i>58 (1966), 722.</span></p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible title2">c) Theological Studies</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p id="165"><span class="sectionnumber">§165 </span>Theological formation “<i>should lead the candidate for the priesthood to a complete and unified vision of the truths which God has revealed in Jesus Christ and of the Church’s experience of faith. Hence the need both to know ‘all’ the Christian truths, without arbitrarily selecting among them, and to know them in an orderly fashion</i>”.<span class="footnumber">(252)</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, n. 54: <i>AAS</i> 84 (1992), 753.</span> It is therefore a fundamental and qualifying stage of the programme of intellectual formation, because “<i>through study, especially the study of theology, the future priest assents to the word of God, grows in his spiritual life and prepares himself to fulfil his pastoral ministry</i>”.<span class="footnumber">(253)</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, n. 51: <i>AAS</i> 84 (1992), 749.</span></p>
      <p id="166"><span class="sectionnumber">§166 </span>The study of Sacred Scripture is the soul of theology,<span class="footnumber">(254)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. <i>Dei Verbum</i>, n. 24: <i>AAS</i> 58 (1966), 828-829.</span> and it must inspire all the theological disciplines. Therefore, biblical formation should be given due importance at all levels, from <i>Lectio</i> to exegesis.<span class="footnumber">(255)</span><span class="footnote">BENEDICT XVI, Post-Synodal Apostolic Exhortation <i>Verbum Domini</i>, n. 35: <i>AAS</i> 102 (2010), 714-715: "<i>a profound gulf is opened up between scientific exegesis and lectio divina. This can give rise to a lack of clarity in the preparation of homilies. It must also be said that this dichotomy can create confusion and a lack of stability in the intellectual formation of candidates for ecclesial ministries. In a word, 'where exegesis is not theology, Scripture cannot be the soul of theology, and conversely, where theology is not essentially the interpretation of the Church's Scripture, such a theology no longer has a foundation'. Hence we need to take a more careful look at the indications provided by the Dogmatic Constitution Dei Verbum in this regard</i>".</span> After a suitable introduction, seminarians should given a careful introduction to accurate exegetical methods, drawing upon auxiliary sciences and special courses. They should be suitably taught by the professors about the nature and the solution of the principal hermeneutical problems. They should also be helped, in an effective way, to gain a perspective of the Sacred Scripture as a whole, and to understand deeply the salient points in the history of salvation and the characteristics of the individual books of the Bible. The professors must make sure they provide the seminarians with a theological synthesis of Divine Revelation, in conformity with the Magisterium, so as to ensure solid foundations for their spiritual life and their future preaching.</p>
      <p>Seminarians should be provided with the opportunity to learn some elements of biblical Hebrew and Greek, through which they can engage with the original biblical texts. Special attention should also be given to a knowledge of the biblical culture and context, especially the history of the People of Israel, so as to improve the understanding of Sacred Scripture and to come to a proper relationship with the people of the Old Covenant. </p>
      <p id="167"><span class="sectionnumber">§167 </span>The sacred liturgy must be considered a fundamental discipline. It should be presented in its theological, spiritual, canonical and pastoral aspects in connection with other disciplines, so that the seminarians can know how the mysteries of salvation are present and operative in the liturgical actions. Additionally, by exploring the texts and rites both of the East and of the West, the sacred liturgy must be seen as an expression of the faith and of the spiritual life of the Church. Seminarians should grasp the essential and unchangeable nucleus of the liturgy, as well as that which belongs instead to particular historical settings and is thus amenable to revision, nevertheless observing diligently relevant liturgical and canonical legislation.<span class="footnumber">(256)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. CIC, can. 838.</span></p>
      <p id="168"><span class="sectionnumber">§168 </span>Dogmatic theology, including sacramental theology, should be taught in a systematic and orderly way. It should begin with the examination of biblical texts. Then the contributions of the Fathers of the Church, from both East and West, should be studied, in order to illustrate the transmission and development of the understanding of revealed truths. The historical progress of dogmas should be shown. Finally, the seminarians should learn how to penetrate more deeply into the mysteries of salvation and to grasp the connection between them by speculative investigation. Moreover, they should learn how to interpret and address life situations in the light of Revelation, how to perceive eternal truths in the changing conditions of human reality, and how to communicate them appropriately to the People of God. </p>
      <p>The doctrine concerning the sources of theology and fundamental theology should be presented in suitable ways from the beginning of theological formation. This should include whatever pertains to the introduction to the faith, with its rational and existential foundations, in a spirit of ecumenism and in ways best suited to the circumstances of today. Historical and sociological elements that exercise a particular influence on Christian life should also be kept in mind. </p>
      <p id="169"><span class="sectionnumber">§169 </span>Moral theology in all its branches must also be anchored in Sacred Scripture, to show how it belongs intrinsically to the one mystery of salvation. Likewise, moral theology will illustrate the Christian way of acting, founded on faith, hope and charity, as a response to the divine call, systematically expounding the call to holiness and freedom. The importance of virtue and the sense of sin should be illustrated, without neglecting, to this end, the most recent developments in anthropology, all the while presenting the moral life as a path which, even if demanding at times, is always directed towards the joy of Christian life.</p>
      <p>This moral doctrine, understood as the ‘law of freedom’ and ‘life according to the Spirit’, finds its completion in <i>spiritual theology</i>. This must include the study of the theology and spirituality of the priesthood, of consecrated life, through the practice of the evangelical counsels, and of the laity. Christian ethics is called to form disciples, each according to the characteristics of his own vocation, towards the path of sanctity. In this context, it will be necessary to provide a course in the <i>Theology of the Consecrated Life</i> within the curriculum of studies, so that future pastors can acquire the essential information and theological content that distinguish the consecrated life, which belongs to the life and holiness of the Church herself.</p>
      <p id="170"><span class="sectionnumber">§170 </span>Pastoral theology is “<i>a scientific reflection on the Church as she is built up daily, by the power of the Spirit, in history […] Pastoral theology is not just an art. Nor is it a set of exhortations, experiences and methods. It is theological in its own right, because it receives from the faith the principles and criteria for the pastoral action of the Church in history, a Church that each day ‘begets’ the Church herself […] Among these principles and criteria, one that is specially important is that of the evangelical discernment of the socio-cultural and ecclesial situation in which the particular pastoral action has to be carried out</i>”.<span class="footnumber">(257)</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, n. 57: <i>AAS</i> 84 (1992), 758-759.</span></p>
      <p id="171"><span class="sectionnumber">§171 </span>In a context of increasing human mobility, in which the entire world has become a ‘global village’, a course in the study of missiology cannot be omitted, as a genuine formation in the universality of the Church and the promotion of its evangelising impulse, not just as <i>missio ad gentes</i>, but also as <i>new evangelisation</i>.</p>
      <p id="172"><span class="sectionnumber">§172 </span>A sufficient number of lectures should be dedicated to teaching the Social Doctrine of the Church. This is because the proclamation of and witness to the Gospel, to which the priest is called, has significant implications for human society, and aims, among other things, at building up the Kingdom of God. This implies a deep knowledge of reality and a reading of human, social and political relations, which determine the lives of individuals and peoples in the light of the Gospel. In this perspective one finds important themes pertaining to the life of the People of God, treated at length by the Magisterium of the Church,<span class="footnumber">(258)</span><span class="footnote">For example, cf. LEO XIII, Encyclical Letter <i>Rerum Novarum</i> (15 May 1891): <i>ASS</i> 23 (1890-1891) 641-670; JOHN XXIII, Encyclical Letter <i>Mater et Magistra</i> (15 May 1961): <i>AAS</i> 53 (1961), 401-464; PAUL VI, Encyclical Letter <i>Popolorum Progressio</i> (26 March 1967): <i>AAS</i> 59 (1967), 257-299; JOHN PAUL II, Encyclical Letter <i>Centesimus Annus</i> (1 May 1991): <i>AAS</i> 83 (1991), 793-867; BENEDICT XVI, Encyclical Letter <i>Caritas in Veritate</i> (29 June 2009): <i>AAS</i> 101 (2009), 641-709.</span> such as the search for the common good, the values of solidarity and subsidiarity among peoples, the education of the young, work and the rights and duties connected with it, the meaning of political authority, the values of justice and peace, social support structures, and the accompaniment of those most in need.</p>
      <p>For some time now, experts and researchers, active in different fields of study, have turned their attention to the emerging planetary crisis, which is reflected strongly in the current Magisterium regarding the ‘ecological question’. Protecting the environment and caring for our common home – the Earth – belong fully to the Christian outlook on man and reality. They constitute in some way the basis for a sound ecology of human relations. Hence they demand, today above all, a “<i>profound interior conversion. It must be said that some committed and prayerful Christians, with the excuse of realism and pragmatism, tend to ridicule expressions of concern for the environment. Others are passive; they choose not to change their habits and thus become inconsistent. So what they all need is an ‘ecological conversion’, whereby the effects of their encounter with Jesus Christ become evident in their relationship with the world around them. Living our vocation to be protectors of God’s handiwork is essential to a life of virtue; it is not an optional or a secondary aspect of our Christian experience</i>”.<span class="footnumber">(259)</span><span class="footnote">FRANCIS, Encyclical Letter <i>Laudato Si'</i> (25 May 2015), n. 217: <i>L'Osservatore Romano</i> 137 (19 June 2015), 6.</span> Therefore, it will be necessary for future priests to be highly sensitive to this theme and, through the requisite Magisterial and theological guidance, helped to “<i>acknowledge the appeal, immensity and urgency of the challenge we face</i>”.<span class="footnumber">(260)</span><span class="footnote">FRANCIS, Encyclical Letter <i>Laudato Si'</i> (25 May 2015), n. 15: <i>L'Osservatore Romano</i> 137 (19 June 2015), 4.</span> This must then be applied to their future priestly ministry, making them promoters of an appropriate care for everything connected to the protection of creation.</p>
      <p id="173"><span class="sectionnumber">§173 </span>By scientifically examining the historical sources, Church history must illustrate the origin and development of the Church as the People of God, which has spread through time and space. In presenting it, the development of theological doctrines and the concrete social, economic and political situations should be taken into account, as should the opinions and categories of thought that have exerted most influence, without neglecting to investigate their reciprocal interdependence and development. Finally, the wonderful encounter between divine and human action should be emphasised, giving seminarians a real sense of the Church and of Tradition. The history of the Church in their own country should receive due attention as well.</p>

For this reason, taking the words used in the promulgation of the Code of 1983, it can be said that the entire Law of the Church “<i>could be understood as a great effort to translate […] the conciliar ecclesiology into canonical language. If, however, it is impossible to translate perfectly into canonical language the conciliar image of the Church, nevertheless, in this image there should always be found as far as possible its essential point of reference</i>”.<span class="footnumber">(262)</span><span class="footnote">JOHN PAUL II, Apostolic Constitution <i>Sacrae Disciplinae Leges</i> (25 January 1983): <i>AAS</i> 75 (1983), Pars II, p. XI.</span> Canon Law places itself, therefore, at the service of the action of the Spirit in the Church, and it favours an efficacious pastoral endeavour within a right discernment of ecclesiastical situations.</p>
      <p>It is appropriate, therefore, that during the time of initial formation the spirit and the study of Canon Law should be promoted, in such a way that priests may come to understand that the remedy for many difficult situations or ‘wounds’ can be found within the Law of the Church, especially concerning the pastoral care of the family. This will assist them to seek “<i>constantly […], the good of the Christian faithful</i>”.<span class="footnumber">(263)</span><span class="footnote">FRANCIS, Apostolic Letter Motu proprio <i>Mitis Iudex Dominus Iesus</i> (15 August 2015); <i>L'Osservatore Romano</i> 204 (9 September 2015), 3.</span></p>

In this way, seminarians will learn to distinguish what belongs to the inculturation of the Gospel and constitutes a real treasure for the Church, from “<i>attachments to imperfect or erroneous types of devotion which are estranged from genuine Biblical revelation</i>”.<span class="footnumber">(273)</span><span class="footnote"><i>Directory on Popular Piety and the Liturgy</i>, n. 1.</span> Seminarians will also have to be introduced to hagiography as a natural elaboration of this theme, with particular reference to the lives of the saints of greatest note.</p>
      <p id="180"><span class="sectionnumber">§180 </span>In order to be better prepared for the demands of priestly ministry, seminarians must receive a careful training in the administration of goods, to be carried out according to canonical norms, soberly, with detachment and moral transparency, along with the necessary skill.<span class="footnumber">(274)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. FRANCIS, <i>Address to Rectors and Students of the Pontifical Colleges and Residences of Rome</i> (12 May 2014); <i>l.c.</i> 5; CIC, can. 282.</span> This will allow for a clear Gospel witness – to which the Christian people are particularly sensitive – facilitating in this way a more effective pastoral action. This formation must include the essential elements of civil law on the subject, with special attention to the duties to be carried out by all Pastors [<i>parochus</i>] and to the need to engage the services of lay people.</p>
      <p id="181"><span class="sectionnumber">§181 </span>Based on the concrete circumstances of where the seminarians are formed, they will have to acquire an appreciation of sacred art. The attention given specifically to this area will provide the future priests with further catechetical resources, as well as giving them a greater awareness of history and the ‘treasures’ to be preserved, which are the patrimony of the particular Churches in which they will work. It should be remembered that a proper appreciation of art and of beauty is in itself a value, which furthermore has a clear pastoral application. In addition, the knowledge of sacred music<span class="footnumber">(275)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. SACRED CONGREGATION FOR RITES, Instruction <i>Musicam Sacram</i>, on Music in the Liturgy (5 March 1967): <i>AAS</i> 59 (1967), 300-320.</span> will contribute to the overall formation of seminarians, and provide them with another resource in view of evangelisation and pastoral endeavour.</p>
      <p id="182"><span class="sectionnumber">§182 </span>Considering the ample attention given by the Magisterium to the theme of social communications,<span class="footnumber">(276)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. SECOND VATICAN ECUMENICAL COUNCIL, Decree on the Media of Social Communications <i>Inter Mirifica</i> (4 December 1963): <i>AAS</i> 56 (1964), 97-138, along with the messages of the Popes for World Communications Day.</span> and the promising area of evangelisation found in the ‘new media’, Seminaries must develop a specific awareness in seminarians in this regard. Accordingly, it will be necessary to understand not only technical ideas and instruments, but above all to familiarise seminarians with their balanced and mature use, avoiding excessive attachment or addiction.</p>
      <p id="183"><span class="sectionnumber">§183 </span>Finally, the teaching of languages in Seminary is of perennial relevance. It is earnestly recommended that seminarians know at least one modern language, taking account of the languages spoken in the countries in which they will exercise the priestly ministry. The questions connected with migration or tourism cannot be ignored in seminary formation, and require that a sufficient linguistic competence is attained.</p>
      <p>As well as Biblical Hebrew and Greek, seminarians should be introduced to the study of Latin from the start of the course of formation, since it provides an access to the sources of the Magisterium and the history of the Church.</p>
      <p id="184"><span class="sectionnumber">§184 </span>The ministerial subjects mentioned, and others judged useful or necessary for priestly ministry, should be studied by the seminarians during the journey of formation, taking into consideration their relevance for the formation programme, and in accordance with the times and methods in the <i>Ratio Nationalis</i>.</p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible title2">e) Specialised Studies</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p id="185"><span class="sectionnumber">§185 </span>In addition to the institutional studies, required for the formation of every priest, the apostolate may require of some a specialised preparation. Besides the possibility of developing some specialisation for the benefit of pastoral ministry, it is important to prepare priests destined for tasks or offices that demand a more specialised preparation by means of pertinent courses or institutes of study.</p>
      <p>In this regard, over and above specialised study of the familiar sacred sciences, other initiatives can also be envisaged, promoted by particular Churches. These may provide for specific formation in areas considered important for certain pastoral situations, and for acquiring the tools and knowledge that will be of assistance in more specific ministries. By way of example one could mention courses for the training of those who will work in Ecclesiastical Tribunals, of Seminary formators, of those engaged in the field of <i>mass media</i>, of those involved in the administration of ecclesiastical goods, and in catechesis.</p>
      <p>To that end, after gathering the necessary information and assessing the needs of the particular Church, insofar as it pertains to their responsibility, Bishops will be able to choose those who, by character, virtue and capability, they consider suitable for these tasks.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <p id="186"><span class="sectionnumber">§186 </span>While taking into account the variety of methods, teaching must ensure the pursuit of the following goals:
      <ol type="a">
        <li>To help the seminarian, from the great quantity of information that he receives, to draw out the essential questions, and to awaken that healthy restlessness of heart, that opens the human spirit to the search for God; </li>
        <li>To achieve the unity and synthesis of intellectual formation, by means of the reciprocal harmony between biblical, theological and philosophical studies. In particular, the seminarian must be helped to order and coordinate the knowledge acquired, so as to overcome the risk that it be learned in a fragmentary way, leading to a disorganised and confused ‘puzzle’;<span class="footnumber">(277)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, n. 54: <i>AAS</i> 84 (1992), 753-754.</span></li>
        <li>To ensure teaching that is clear and sound, that seeks to impart better knowledge of the mystery of God and His Church, the truths of faith and their hierarchy,<span class="footnumber">(278)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. CIC, cann. 750, 752-754.</span> man and the contemporary world; </li>
        <li>To promote dialogue and engagement among seminarians, and between seminarians and their professors, through an ability to sustain logical and rational discussion; </li>
        <li>To offer seminarians an historical perspective, so that they can appreciate the connection between faith and historical development, learning to express adequately the content of their philosophical and theological formation.</li>
      </ol>
      </p>
      <p id="187"><span class="sectionnumber">§187 </span><i>Practical Guidelines</i>. Regarding teaching methods, the following should be taken into consideration:
      <ol type="a">
        <li>In institutional courses, those who teach should present the essential content of the subject matter, giving the seminarians suggestions for their personal study and bibliography; </li>
        <li>Professors must take care to teach Catholic doctrine, with reference especially to the richness of the Magisterium of the Church, and giving privileged attention to the Pontifical Magisterium and to the Ecumenical Councils, in order to respond to the challenges of the new evangelisation and the current reality; </li>
        <li>Interdisciplinary seminars should be offered, to make common study more fruitful and to promote creative collaboration between teachers and seminarians at the scientific and intellectual level; </li>
        <li>Personal study under the guidance of ‘tutors’ should be encouraged, so that the seminarians can learn a method suitable for scholarly research and, being duly supported and encouraged, they can adequately assimilate the teaching imparted to them;</li>
        <li>The seminarians should be introduced to the study of various pastoral questions by a scientific method, so that they can better comprehend the intimate connection between life, piety and the knowledge attained in lectures;<span class="footnumber">(279)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. CIC, can. 254, § 2.</span></li>
        <li>Where the Conference of Bishops considers it suitable, a period of formation can be provided outside of the Seminary, at times in other countries, to learn useful languages or to get to know the life of the Church rooted in a different culture.</li>
      </ol>
      </p>
      <p>A basic organisational structure is required for study to be truly fruitful, and a sufficient number of well-trained teachers will be a part of this.<span class="footnumber">(280)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. CIC, can. 253, §§ 1-2.</span> A well-organised and well-run library, overseen by competent personnel, and internet access as an instrument of research and communication, is also necessary.</p>
      <p>Seminarians are expected to give proof of the progress made in study by exams, both oral and written, and by written papers, according to the norms established by the Conferences of Bishops. </p>

    <div class="content">
      <p id="188"><span class="sectionnumber">§188 </span>It should be remembered, above all, that the Seminary, more than a building, is a community of formation, wherever it is found. Therefore, Bishops who consider it feasible to establish or maintain a diocesan Seminary,<span class="footnumber">(281)</span><span class="footnote">Cf.

Naturally, they must also take into consideration the financial viability of the institution.</p>
      <p>When circumstances do not allow for this, it is necessary to seek a suitable solution, in consultation with the other Bishops of the Ecclesiastical Province or the Conference of Bishops. This may lead to entrusting seminarians to the Seminary of another particular Church, or opening interdiocesan Seminaries, having obtained the approval of the Congregation for the Clergy regarding both the erection of such a Seminary and its Statutes.<span class="footnumber">(283)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. CIC, can. 237, § 2.</span></p>
      <p>Seminarians sent to pursue their studies in an institute other than their own Seminary deserve particular attention. In this case, the diocesan Bishop must ensure that they belong to a true community of formation. He must carefully avoid a situation in which a seminarian, or a small group of candidates, have their normal residence in a private dwelling, where it would be impossible to cultivate appropriately either their spiritual life or their community life.</p>
      <p>A seminarian who lawfully resides outside the Seminary is to be entrusted by his diocesan Bishop to a suitable priest, who shall diligently see to his spiritual formation and discipline.<span class="footnumber">(284)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. CIC, can. 235, § 2.</span></p>

      <p>Formators must ensure that those who have had painful experiences in this area receive special and suitable accompaniment.</p>
      <p>Specific lessons, seminars or courses on the protection of minors are to be included in the programmes of initial and ongoing formation. Adequate information must be provided in an appropriate fashion, which also gives attention to areas dealing with possible exploitation and violence, such as, for example, the trafficking of minors, child labour, and the sexual abuse of minors or vulnerable adults.</p>
      <p>To this end, it would be appropriate and fruitful for the Conference of Bishops or the Bishop responsible for the Seminary to establish a dialogue with the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors,<span class="footnumber">(310)</span><span class="footnote">Instituted by Pope FRANCIS, with the Chirograph <i>Minorum Tutela Actuosa</i> (22 March 2014); its Statutes were promulgated on 21 April 2015.</span> whose specific competence is “<i>to propose to [the Holy Father] the most opportune initiatives for protecting minors and vulnerable adults, in order that we may do everything possible to ensure that crimes such as those which have occurred are no longer repeated in the Church.

      <p id="203"><span class="sectionnumber">§203 </span>By way of an accurate and careful examination, the Bishop “<i>with prudent forethought, and via scrutinies, […] should establish that each of the candidates is suitable for holy orders and fully committed to living the demands of the Catholic priesthood.

      <p id="204"><span class="sectionnumber">§204 </span>The discernment of the suitability of the candidate is known as the ‘scrutiny’. It must be undertaken at certain points, five in fact, along the <i>iter</i> of priestly formation: admission to candidacy for Orders, the ministries (of lector and acolyte), diaconate,<span class="footnumber">(313)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. CIC, can. 1051.</span> and priesthood.<span class="footnumber">(314)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. <i>Entre las Más Delicadas</i>, n. 4: <i>l.c.</i>, 496.</span> These scrutinies are not merely formal and bureaucratic acts that employ standard and generic formulae, but give the authoritative assessment concerning the vocation of a specific person and its development, by those who have been authorised to do so by virtue of their office and in the name of the Church. The scrutinies aim to verify the actual presence of the qualities and personal circumstances of a candidate regarding each of the aforementioned points of the formative <i>iter</i>. Accordingly, they must be prepared in writing and contain a motivated evaluation, positive or negative, giving reasons, concerning the journey so far completed by the candidate. </p>
      <p id="205"><span class="sectionnumber">§205 </span>While certain elements will have to be verified at specific points, for every scrutiny the community of formators must present to the diocesan Bishop of the seminarian:
      <ol type="a">
        <li>The request of the candidate written in his own hand;</li>
        <li>A detailed report from the Rector (that of the Seminary in which the candidate is being formed and, in the case of interdiocesan Seminaries, also that of the diocesan Seminary or of the Director of Vocations), including an assessment concerning the outcome of the preceding period, along with all the information considered useful for a better understanding of the situation and for the assessment by the community of formators, keeping in mind the requirements of can. 240 §2 C.I.C.; </li>
        <li>A report by the Pastor [<i>parochus</i>] of the parish of origin of the candidate or of the parish where he has domicile;</li>
        <li>A report to be sought from those to whom the candidate was sent for his pastoral service; it may also be useful to have the contribution of women who know the candidate, thus including female assessment and insight. </li>
      </ol>
      </p>
      <p id="206"><span class="sectionnumber">§206 </span>Before conferring sacred Ordination, it is also necessary to verify that the prescribed period of formation has been completed, that the candidate possesses the necessary human and spiritual qualities, that no impediments or irregularities are present,<span class="footnumber">(315)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. CIC, cann. 1041-1042. Two circular letters of the Congregation for Catholic Educations have insisted on the duty of Bishops and of other Church bodies to inform candidates as soon as possible about the canonical discipline on impediments and irregularities; cf. the Circular Letter of 27 July 1992 (Prot. No. 1560/90/18), and the Circular Letter of 2 February 1999 (Prot. No. 1560/90/33).</span> that the requisite sacraments have been received, and that the spiritual exercises have been completed as required for ordination.<span class="footnumber">(316)</span><span class="footnote">The following requirements must be completed for Sacred Ordination, both diaconal and presbyteral: the request of the candidate written in his own hand and addressed to th Bishop, in which he states his awareness and freedom in receiving Orders and assuming its duties (both for diaconate and for priesthood); a retreat, lasting at least five days (cf. can. 1039 CIC); making the profession of faith and taking the oath of fidelity, preferably in public, before the Ordinary of the place or his Delegate, and the signing of the act.</span> In general, the norm of can. 1052 §1 C.I.C. must always be observed, on the basis of which suitability must be clearly demonstrated and reasons given or, in other words “<i>positive arguments give moral certainty of the suitability of the candidate</i>”,<span class="footnumber">(317)</span><span class="footnote"><i>Entre las Más Delicadas</i>, n. 2: <i>l.c.</i>, 495.</span> and not simply the absence of problematic situations.</p>
      <p>As is known, the Bishop has ultimate and definitive canonical responsibility for the call to Holy Orders. However, he has the moral obligation to consider with the greatest attention the final assessment of the community of formators, formulated by the Rector, who draws together the fruits of what has been experienced over the course of several years of formation. Experience has shown that when Ordinaries have not accepted the negative judgement of the community of formators, it has been the cause of great suffering in many cases, both for the candidates themselves and for the local Churches. The Bishop should not give a date for diaconal ordination and should not allow the celebration of the diaconate to be prepared, before he is certain that all the necessary studies have been completed correctly, meaning that the candidate has actually passed all the exams required by the curriculum of philosophical and theological studies, including those of the fifth year.<span class="footnumber">(318)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. CIC, can. 1032, § 1.</span></p>
      <p id="207"><span class="sectionnumber">§207 </span>In particular the following must also be considered:
      <ol type="a">
        <li>the outcome of the canonical notification in the place where the candidate has had a lengthy domicile; </li>
        <li>observance of the age at which the sacrament of Orders can be received (cf. can. 1031 §1 C.I.C.);</li>
        <li>respect for the interval foreseen between one ministry and another, between acolyte and diaconate, taking account of can. 1035 C.I.C. and of any further determinations by the Conference of Bishops; </li>
        <li>verification of impediments (cf. can. 1042 C.I.C.: marriage; activities forbidden to clerics; being a neophyte; and a situation such as someone who has returned to the faith or religious practice, having been lapsed for many years, according to the judgement of the Bishop), and for irregularities (cf. can. 1041, 2°-6° C.I.C.: the delict of apostasy, heresy or schism; attempted marriage, even only civilly; voluntary homicide or procured abortion; self-mutilation or attempted suicide; simulation of acts of the power of orders);</li>
        <li>prior to conferring the presbyterate, a period in which the diaconal ministry has been exercised practically.</li>
      </ol>
      </p>
      <p id="208"><span class="sectionnumber">§208 </span>The requirements for the reception of diaconal or presbyteral ordination can be dispensed:
      <ol type="a">
        <li>regarding age: the Bishop can dispense up to one year; one must have recourse to the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments to dispense from more than one year;<span class="footnumber">(319)</span><span class="footnote">Cf.

      </ol>
      </p>
      <p id="209"><span class="sectionnumber">§209 </span>The judgement about the suitability of a candidate to receive the transitional diaconate, with a view to priesthood, must also include one about his suitability for priestly ministry, taking can. 1030 C.I.C. into account. It is fundamental to recall that an assessment for conferral of the transitional diaconate implies potentially a judgment about suitability for priesthood; no one is to be admitted to the diaconate <i>ad experimentum</i>. There is a presumption of suitability for priesthood after diaconal ordination, but the Bishop may be able to demonstrate the contrary, with clear arguments, both for prior behaviour, not considered at the time of admission to diaconate, and for behaviour which occurs afterwards, according to can. 1030 C.I.C. </p>
      <p id="210"><span class="sectionnumber">§210 </span>According to his prudent judgement, the Bishop, taking into account the assessment of the formators, is to provide for the admission of the candidate to ordination or to express his refusal. It is fitting that the Bishop express his decision in the form of a decree, providing at least in summary form the reasons for what he has decided.<span class="footnumber">(322)</span><span class="footnote">Cf. <i>Entre las Más Delicadas</i>, Appendix III, n. 10: <i>l.c.</i>, 498.</span></p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>The Second Vatican Council proposed that priests should see in Mary the perfect model of their very existence, invoking her as “Mother of the Eternal High Priest, Queen of Apostles and Protector of their own ministry”, and inviting them to “love and venerate [her] with filial devotion and veneration” (<i>Presbyterorum Ordinis</i>, 18).</p>
    <p>This new <i>Ratio Fundamentalis Istitutionis Sacerdotalis</i> is given for the benefit of priests, whose life and formation are placed under the mantle of Mary, who is Mother of Mercy and Mother of Priests.</p>
    <p>The Holy Father Francis has approved the present General Executory Decree and has ordered its publication.</p>
    <p>Given at Rome, at the Seat of the Congregation for the Clergy, 8 December 2016, the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary.</p>
