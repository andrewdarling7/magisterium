    <p>For he assumed at his first coming<br>

      and opened for us the way to eternal salvation,<br>
      that, when he comes again in glory and majesty<br>
      and all is at last made manifest,<br>
      we who watch for that day<br>
      may inherit the great promise<br>
      in which now we dare to hope.<br>

    <p>And so, with Angels and Archangels,<br>
      with Thrones and Dominions,<br>
      and with all the hosts and Powers of heaven,<br>

    <p>For all the oracles of the prophets foretold him,<br>
      the Virgin Mother longed for him<br>
      with love beyond all telling,<br>
      John the Baptist sang of his coming<br>
      and proclaimed his presence when he came.</p>

    <p>It is by his gift that already we rejoice<br>
      at the mystery of his Nativity,<br>
      so that he may find us watchful in prayer<br>
      and exultant in his praise.</p>

    <p>And so, with Angels and Archangels,<br>

    <p>Through him the Angels praise your majesty,<br>

      Heaven and the Virtues of heaven and the blessed Seraphim<br>
      worship together with exultation.<br>

      he consecrated through his fast<br>
      the pattern of our Lenten observance<br>
      and, by overturning the snares of the ancient serpent,<br>
      taught us to cast out the leaven of malice,<br>
      so that, celebrating the Paschal Mystery,<br>
      we might pass over at last to the eternal paschal feast.</p>

      always and everywhere to give you thanks,<br>
      Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God.</p>

    <p>For in the waters of the Jordan<br>
      you revealed with signs and wonders a new Baptism,<br>
      so that through the voice that came down from heaven<br>
      we might come to believe in your Word dwelling among us,<br>
      and by the Spirit’s descending in the likeness of a dove<br>
      we might know that Christ your Servant<br>
      has been anointed with the oil of gladness<br>
      and sent to bring the good news to the poor.</p>

    <p>And so, with the Powers of heaven,<br>
      we worship you constantly on earth,<br>
      and before your majesty<br>
      without end we acclaim:</p>

    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.<br>
      Heaven and earth are full of your glory.<br>
      Hosanna in the highest.<br>
      Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.<br>
      Hosanna in the highest.</p>

      you placed her above all others<br>
      to be for your people an advocate of grace<br>
