  <h3>EUCHARISTIC PRAYER I<br><span style="color: black;">(THE ROMAN CANON)</span></h3>
  <h6>The Priest, with hands extended, says:</h6>
  <p>To you, therefore, most merciful Father,<br>
    we make humble prayer and petition<br>
    through Jesus Christ, your Son, our Lord:</p>
  <h6>He joins his hands and says</h6>
  <p>that you accept</p>
  <h6>He makes the Sign of the Cross once over the bread and chalice together, saying:</h6>
  <p>and bless <span class="red"><b>&#10016;</b></span> these gifts, these offerings,<br>
    these holy and unblemished sacrifices,</p>
  <h6>With hands extended, he continues:</h6>
  <p>which we offer you firstly<br>
    for your holy catholic Church.<br>
    Be pleased to grant her peace,<br>
    to guard, unite and govern her<br>
    throughout the whole world,<br>
    together with your servant <span class="red">N.</span> our Pope<br>
    and <span class="red">N.</span> our Bishop,<span class="red">*</span><br>

  <h5>COMMEMORATION OF THE LIVING</h5>
  <p>Remember, Lord, your servants <span class="red">(N.</span> and <span class="red">N.)</span></p>
  <h6>The Priest joins his hands and prays briefly for those for whom he intends to pray.</h6>
  <h6>Then, with hands extended, he continues:</h6>
  <p>and all gathered here,<br>
    whose faith and devotion are known to you.<br>
    For them, we offer you this sacrifice of praise<br>
    or they offer it for themselves<br>
    and all who are dear to them:<br>
    for the redemption of their souls,<br>
    in hope of health and well-being,<br>
    and paying their homage to you,<br>
    the eternal God, living and true. </p>

    to you, O God, his almighty Father,<br>
    giving you thanks, he said the blessing,<br>
    broke the bread<br>
    and gave it to his disciples, saying:</p>

  <p>TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND EAT OF IT,<br>
    FOR THIS IS MY BODY,<br>
    WHICH WILL BE GIVEN UP FOR YOU.</p>

  <p>In a similar way, when supper was ended,<br>
    he took this precious chalice<br>
    in his holy and venerable hands,<br>
    and once more giving you thanks, he said the blessing<br>
    and gave the chalice to his disciples, saying:<br>

  <p>TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND DRINK FROM IT,<br>
    FOR THIS IS THE CHALICE OF MY BLOOD,<br>
    THE BLOOD OF THE NEW AND ETERNAL COVENANT,<br>
