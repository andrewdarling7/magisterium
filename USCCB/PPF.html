  <div class="content">
    <p>On November 12, 2019, the members of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops approved the <i>Program of Priestly Formation in the United States of America</i> (sixth edition) as the <i>Ratio Nationalis Institutionis Sacerdotalis</i> for the United States to be observed in seminaries for the formation of priests.</p>
    <p>This action of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, made in accord with canon 242 §1 of the <i>Code of Canon Law</i> and the <i>Ratio Fundamentalis Institutionis Sacerdotalis</i>, n. 3, was granted <i>confirmatio ad quinquennium </i>by the Congregation for the Clergy (Prot. N. 2022 0557), by a decree signed by Most Reverend Lazzaro You Heung-sik, Prefect of the Congregation for the Clergy, and Most Reverend Andrés Gabriel Ferrada Moreira, Secretary for Seminaries, and dated March 22, 2022.</p>
    <p>As President of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, I therefore decree the promulgation of the <i>Program of Priestly Formation in the United States of America</i> (sixth edition), which is to be observed in all seminaries, whether diocesan or interdiocesan, effective August 4, 2023, the Feast of St. John Vianney.</p>
    <p>Given at the offices of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops in Washington, the District of Columbia, on the 24th day of June in the year of our Lord 2022 the Solemnity of The Most Sacred Heart of Jesus.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>The development of this sixth edition of the <i>Program of Priestly Formation</i> (PPF) began with a review of the fifth edition by the Committee on Canonical Affairs and Church Governance, the National Association of Catholic Theological Schools, the National Association of College Seminaries and the National Conference of Diocesan Vocation Directors. Following the consultation of the full Conference at regional meetings of the USCCB, a request was made to the Congregation for the Clergy for a simple renewal of the recognitio for the fifth edition, which was granted on October 15, 2015. In December 2016, the new <i>Ratio Fundamentalis Institutionis Sacerdotalis</i> was released; in 2016, Bishop Michael Burbidge, Chair of the Committee on Clergy, Consecrated Life and Vocations (2013- 2016), formed a working group to draft a new edition of the PPF.</p>
    <p>The working group completed their work under the new Chair of the CCLV, His Eminence, Joseph Cardinal Tobin, C.Ss.R. (2016-2019). Members of the working group included Bishop Earl Boyea, Chair; Bishop Peter Baldacchino; Bishop Andrew Cozzens; Bishop Michael Olson; Bishop Thomas Paprocki; Msgr. Todd Lajiness; Msgr. Robert Panke; Rev. John Pavlik, OFM Cap; Rev. Tobias Rodriguez; Reverend Gladstone Stevens, PSS; and Rev. Jorge Torres, while Rev. Ralph O’Donnell, Rev. Luke Ballman and Rev. Daniel Hanley of the CCLV Secretariat supported the working group.</p>
    <p>Following the completion of the draft, feedback from the CCLV Collaborating Committees and experts was incorporated into the text. The document was approved by the General Assembly in November 2019 and subsequently submitted to the Congregation for the Clergy for recognitio. Pope Francis modified CIC, c. 242 §1 <i>motu proprio</i> on February 11, 2022, changing <i>recognitio</i> to <i>confirmatio</i>. On March 22, 2022, Archbishop Lazzaro You Heung-sik, Prefect of the Congregation for the Clergy, and Archbishop Andrés Gabriel Ferrada Moreira, Secretary, issued the Decree confirming ad quinquennium the sixth edition of the <i>Program of Priestly Formation</i>. The Decree noted that the Conference, “welcoming the indications of the recent Magisterium, intends to offer candidates for priestly ministry a human, spiritual, intellectual, and pastoral formation achieved through an optimum community life and animated by a missionary spirit of evangelization that is congruous to the needs of the present age.”</p>
    <p>The members of the CCLV Committee who brought this project to completion are Bishop James Checchio, Chair; Archbishop Samuel Aquila; Archbishop Charles Thompson; Bishop Juan Miguel Betancourt; Bishop Earl Boyea; Bishop Ronald Hicks; Bishop David Malloy; and Bishop Daniel Mueggenborg. With the successful completion of this document, the Bishops’ Committee on Clergy, Consecrated Life and Vocations is pleased to offer this <i>Program of Priestly Formation</i> with much gratitude for all those who participated in the project.</p>
    <p>On behalf of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Committee on Clergy, Consecrated Life and Vocations, we thank all those who have worked throughout these six years on this effort. I also offer our prayers and support for all those who participate in the vital work of vocations and priestly formation. May Mary, Queen of the Clergy, ever assist us in this vital ministry for our Church.</p>

    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="1">§1</span> The documents of the Second Vatican Council<span class="footnumber">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</span> <span class="footnote">Among these, of special importance are <i>Lumen Gentium</i>, <i>Christus Dominus</i>, and <i>Presbyterorum Ordinis</i>.</span>form an essential resource for the program of priestly formation along with the Council’s specific treatment of priestly formation found in <i>Optatam Totius</i> (<i>Decree on the Training of Priests</i>). The teaching of the Second Vatican Council establishes the normative understanding of the presbyteral office. As authentic articulations of the Church’s faith, these documents along with <i>Ratio Fundamentalis Sacerdotalis Institutionis</i> (The Gift of the Priestly Vocation, 2016), the Post-Synodal Apostolic Exhortation <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i> (I Will Give You Shepherds, 1992), the <i>Code of Canon Law</i> (1983), the <i>Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches</i> (1990), and the <i>Catechism of the Catholic Church</i> (1997) shape this current <i>Program of Priestly Formation</i>.
    </p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="2">§2 </span>Other documents of the Holy See pertaining to priestly formation and treating specific aspects of seminary programs also contribute to this edition of the <i>Program of Priestly Formation</i>,<span class="footnumber">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</span> <span class="footnote">The Holy See has given direction on the teaching of philosophy (1972), theology (1976), canon law (1975), mutual relations between bishops and religious (1978), liturgical formation (1979), social communications (1986), pastoral care of people on the move (1986), Oriental Churches (1987), social doctrine (1988), Mariology (1988), patristics (1989), formation in religious institutes (1990), marriage (1995), ecumenism (1998), Fraternal Life in Community (1994), and the interrelation of theology and philosophy (1998). The Congregation for Catholic Education has also commented on other aspects of formation, notably celibacy (1974), Sapientia Christiana (1979), and spiritual formation (1980). Additional documents of the Holy See that were issued following the promulgation of the <i>Program of Priestly Formation</i>, fifth edition, include Congregation for Catholic Education, Instruction Concerning the Criteria for the Discernment of Vocations with Regard to Persons with Homosexual Tendencies in View of Their Admission to the Seminary and to Holy Orders (2005); Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Minimum Profile of Formation for Former Protestant Ministers Who Desire to Be Ordained Catholic Priests (2007); Congregation for Catholic Education, <i>Guidelines for the Use of Psychology in the Admission and Formation of Candidates for the Priesthood</i> (2008); Congregation for Catholic Education, Decree on the Reform of Ecclesiastical Studies of Philosophy (2011); and Pope Francis, <i>Veritatis Gaudium</i> (2017).</span> along with documents published by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) and the Bishops’ Committee on Clergy, Consecrated Life, and Vocations (CCLV) identifying particular concerns and giving specific directions in light of needs and experiences in the United States.<span class="footnumber">3</span> <span class="footnote">These include documents, for example, on spiritual formation (1983), liturgy (1984), and pastoral formation (1985). Additional documents are Preaching the Mystery of Faith: The Sunday Homily (2013), <i>Guidelines for the Use of Psychology in Seminary Admissions</i> (2015), and <i>Guidelines for Receiving Pastoral Ministers in the United States</i> (2014).</span> The Bishops’ Committee on Priestly Life and Ministry, one of the predecessor committees to the Bishops’ Committee on CCLV, also contributed a series of important documents on priestly ministry and life that also has influenced this edition of the <i>Program of Priestly Formation</i>.<span class="footnumber">4</span><span class="footnote">These include documents, for example, on preaching (1982), stress (1982), sexuality (1983), general health of priests (1983), ongoing formation (1984), the role of pastor (1987), morale (1989), and a basic plan for the ongoing formation of priests (2001).</span></p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="3">§3 </span>The central focus of this latest version of the <i>Program of Priestly Formation</i> comes from reflecting on the lived experience of seminaries and the Church in the United States in these opening decades of the twenty- first century and takes its inspiration from the <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i> published in 2016: “The fundamental idea is that Seminaries should form missionary disciples who are ‘in love’ with the Master, shepherds ‘with the smell of the sheep,’ who live in their midst to bring the mercy of God to them.”<span class="footnumber">5</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, Introduction, no. 3.</span></p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="4">§4 </span>This <i>Program of Priestly Formation</i> begins with an introduction to its central operating theme that priestly formation is an integrated journey, grounded in community and missionary in spirit. Building on this theme, the <i>Program of Priestly Formation</i> then explores the theological foundations of the ministerial priesthood, a description of the life of priests, and the Church’s role in promoting priestly vocations. After this foundation, the text then outlines the process for admission into a formation program.</p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="5">§5 </span>In the two chapters that follow those discussions, the text describes seminary formation. First is a discussion of the necessity of proper accompaniment. Here, the various people responsible for accompanying a seminarian through his formation are described. The next chapter sketches the structural elements of seminary formation, beginning with the importance of integrating the dimensions (human, spiritual, intellectual, and pastoral) into the stages of seminary formation (propaedeutic, discipleship, configuration, and vocational synthesis). The goal of this integration is to aid the seminarian in cooperating with God’s grace in conforming his heart as a disciple of Jesus Christ to the service of the Church in pastoral charity. The stages of seminary formation are then described in more detail. That chapter concludes with a description of the seminary community and the norms for evaluation.</p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="6">§6 </span>Four chapters follow the chapter on seminary formation and present a detailed description of how each of the four dimensions (human, spiritual, intellectual, and pastoral), respectively, is to be integrated at each of the four stages of seminary formation (propaedeutic, discipleship, configuration, and vocational synthesis). Each chapter includes the benchmarks for that dimension, which the seminarian is expected to achieve before moving to the next stage.</p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="7">§7 </span>This <i>Program of Priestly Formation</i> continues with a chapter about the ongoing formation of priests. This chapter is intended to help all those involved in the preparation of seminarians for the priesthood, including the seminarians themselves, to recognize that the seminary lays a foundation for a lifetime of formation. The USCCB, however, does have a separate document that presents ongoing formation in more detail.<span class="footnumber">6</span><span class="footnote">USCCB, <i>The Basic Plan for the Ongoing Formation of Priests</i> (Washington, DC: USCCB, 2001). As of the publication of this <i>Program of Priestly Formation</i>, the Basic Plan is being revised; the second edition will be published soon.</span> The <i>Program of Priestly Formation</i> concludes with a section on seminaries that describes their governance, leadership, and personnel. The <i>Program of Priestly Formation</i>, then, is normative for United States seminary programs and serves as a basis for future visitations.<span class="footnumber">7</span><span class="footnote">See CIC, cc. 242, 455. This <i>Program of Priestly Formation</i> is intended to serve the entire Catholic Church in the United States. Some of its principles, norms, and pastoral applications are specific to the Latin Church. Nonetheless, the <i>Program of Priestly Formation</i> is also normative for all Eastern Catholic Churches sui iuris in the United States except where it conflicts with their particular traditions and pastoral life and with the requirements of the CCEO.</span></p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="8">§8 </span>A Brief Note on Terminology: When the term “ecclesiastical entity” is used in this document, it refers to the diocese or eparchy, personal ordinariate, institute of consecrated life, or society of apostolic life for which a seminarian is preparing for ordained ministry in the Church in the United States. At the same time, each seminary, with the approval of the diocesan bishop or the bishops concerned, or of the competent authority of an institute of consecrated life or society of apostolic life as the case may be, is to develop, articulate, and implement its own particular program in conformity with the <i>Program of Priestly Formation</i>. The term “discerner” refers to a man who has not yet entered the propaedeutic stage and is in the process of discerning entry into the first stage of initial priestly formation. The term “seminarian” refers to a man who has been accepted into a seminary formation program. The term “candidate” refers to a seminarian who has received the Rite of Candidacy. The term “professor” refers to anyone who teaches courses, clergy and laity. The term “specialist” refers to a member of the formative community who is engaged in a specialized field (e.g., psychologist, counselor, librarian, business manager, and so on). The term “formative community” refers broadly to the larger community within the Church that is involved in varied ways in the discernment and initial formation of men preparing for the priesthood. It refers to the bishop and his priests and collaborators in the diocese and to all members of the seminary community, including priest formators, professors, specialists, other seminary staff, and above all, the seminarians themselves. It also refers to those engaged with the seminarian in his pastoral placements. Finally, it includes his family, parish, and others who are involved in his vocational journey. For members of an institute of consecrated life or a society of apostolic life, the term “formative community” includes members of his institute or society. The term “seminary community” is narrower in meaning and refers specifically to the community of seminarians, priest formators, professors, specialists, and other seminary staff. The term “community of formators” is limited to those priests, both in the external forum and internal forum, who are engaged with the seminarian in his formation. The term “formator” is limited to priests. The term “biweekly” refers to an event that occurs every other week.</p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="9">§9 </span>Care has been taken in this document to limit the use of prescriptive and exhortative language to two terms. The word “must” means that an action is required. Authorization from the competent authority is required for an exception from following the required course of action. The word “should” means that an action is highly recommended, such that a nonarbitrary reason is necessary for the decision not to pursue this course of action.</p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible title2">Priestly Formation: One, Integral, Grounded in Community, and Missionary in Spirit</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="10">§10 </span>The journey of priestly formation begins at Baptism, when the new disciple of Jesus Christ begins to live the call to follow Christ in holiness. It is the same call disciples of Jesus have received since the foundation of the Church. St. John Paul II described seminary formation as “a continuation in the Church of the apostolic community gathered about Jesus, listening to his word, proceeding toward the Easter experience, awaiting the gift of the Spirit for the mission.”<span class="footnumber">8</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 60.</span> This singular “journey of discipleship,” begun in Baptism, “comes to be appreciated as the center of one’s life at the beginning of Seminary formation, and continues through the whole of life.”<span class="footnumber">9</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, Introduction, no. 3.</span></p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="11">§11 </span>Priestly formation is an integral journey in which the four dimensions of human, spiritual, intellectual, and pastoral formation are woven together in such a way that, while identified as distinct dimensions, they can be seen as an “integrated journey of the disciple called to priesthood.”<span class="footnumber">10</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, Introduction, no. 3.</span></p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="12">§12 </span>This integrated journey of discipleship is aimed at conforming the heart to the heart of Christ.<span class="footnumber">11</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 89; <i>Optatam Totius</i>, no. 4; <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 57.</span> Being thus conformed to Christ leads the priest to pastoral charity, which animates all aspects of the life of the priest.<span class="footnumber">12</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 57.</span></p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="13">§13 </span>The call to priesthood is essentially communitarian in nature. It is within the community of the family, parish, or ecclesial movement, or through interaction with an institute of consecrated life or society of apostolic life, that a vocation to priesthood is discovered. This vocation is discerned and nurtured within the seminary community. “This community leads the seminarian, through ordination, to become part of the ‘family’ of the presbyterate, at the service of a particular community.”<span class="footnumber">13</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, Introduction, no. 3.</span></p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="14">§14 </span>All Christians are prompted by the Holy Spirit to share the love of Jesus Christ with others; they are called to missionary discipleship. Baptism and Confirmation equip them to evangelize in all that they say and do.<span class="footnumber">14</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Evangelii Gaudium</i>, nos. 120-121.</span> Ministerial priesthood flows from this same call to missionary discipleship yet remains distinct.<span class="footnumber">15</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Lumen Gentium</i>, no. 10.</span> The goal of priestly formation is to form missionary disciples so that they are ready for consecration as shepherds for God’s People, sharing in the authority of Christ the Redeemer, who sent the Apostles to preach and heal.<span class="footnumber">16</span><span class="footnote">See Lk 9:1-6, Mt 10:1-15, Mk 6:7-13.</span> In this way, priestly formation clearly must have a missionary character.<span class="footnumber">17</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, Introduction, no. 3.</span></p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="15">§15 </span>Priestly formation today continues in the spirit of the response of the first disciples and their communion of life. The Gospel foundation of priestly formation precedes programs, structures, and plans. What was vital and essential for that first community of disciples remains so today for those engaged in priestly formation: “As he was walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter, and his brother Andrew, casting a net into the sea; they were fishermen. He said to them, ‘Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men.’ At once they left their nets and followed him” (Mt 4:18-20).</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="16">§16 </span>The Church continues to place the highest value on the work of priestly formation, because it is linked to the very mission of the Church, especially the evangelization of humanity:<span class="footnumber">18</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 2.</span> “Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations” (Mt 28:19). The apostolic origins of the Church, which bind all believers in communion with the Lord and his mission, motivate those who engage in the ministry of priestly formation, underscore the urgency of their task, and remind them of their great responsibility.</p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible title2">Priestly Formation in the Context of the World and the Church Today</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="17">§17 </span>Priestly formation takes place in a given ecclesial and historical context. Identifying that context is a critical task for giving specific shape to particular programs of formation. The importance of context is highlighted in <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>: “God always calls his priests from specific human and ecclesial contexts, which inevitably influence them; and to these same contexts the priest is sent for the service of Christ’s Gospel.”<span class="footnumber">19</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 5.</span></p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="18">§18 </span>Worldwide, the current secular culture—“the economy of exclusion, the idolatry of money, the iniquity that generates violence, the primacy of appearance over being, postmodern individualism and globalization, as well as the reality of ethical relativism and religious indifference” <span class="footnumber">20</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 175.</span>—presents many questions and challenges. </p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="19">§19 </span>There are also many significant challenges, blessings, and opportunities that are particular to the United States in the twenty-first century. These play an important part in shaping seminary formation today. They also set the horizon for priestly ministry in the years ahead. Some of the more significant challenges are related to (1) American culture, (2) the Catholic Church in the United States, and (3) the discerners and seminarians themselves.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="20">§20 </span>(1) First, as it relates to American culture:
      <ol type="a">
        <li>The United States is a nation with a rich cultural heritage of freedom, equality, justice for the oppressed, and open dialogue.<span class="footnumber">21</span><span class="footnote">Pope Francis recognized this in his address to the US Congress during his 2015 papal visit: “A nation can be considered great when it defends liberty as [Abraham] Lincoln did, when it fosters a culture which enables people to ‘dream’ of full rights for all their brothers and sisters, as Martin Luther King sought to do; when it strives for justice and the cause of the oppressed, as Dorothy Day did by her tireless work, the fruit of a faith which becomes dialogue and sows peace in the contemplative style of Thomas Merton.” Francis, “Visit to the Joint Session of the United States Congress” (address, US Capitol, Washington, DC, September 24, 2015), <a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/speeches/2015/september/documents/papa-francesco_20150924_usa-us-congress.html" target="blank">www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/speeches/2015/september/documents/papa-francesco_20150924_usa-us-congress.html</a> (accessed December 23, 2021).</span> However, an “economy of exclusion and inequality” leaves many families trapped in a cycle of poverty.<span class="footnumber">22</span><span class="footnote"><i>Evangelii Gaudium</i>, no. 53; see Francis, “Visit to the Joint Session of the United States Congress.”</span> Migrants and refugees fleeing hardship and violence continue to arrive in US communities. The evil of racism continues to be a factor in the social fabric of the United States; Catholic institutions are not immune to the persistence of racism in society.<span class="footnumber">23</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Evangelii Gaudium</i>, no. 53.</span></li>
        <li>In most areas of the United States, the norm is a high level of cultural, linguistic, and economic diversity. Continued Catholic immigration has situated numerous newly arrived people, who present their own economic and religious issues, alongside numerous other Catholic laity who are native-born. Both groups share a common Church, have very different backgrounds, and can be mutually enriched by the exchange of their gifts.</li>
        <li>In the United States at this time, there is the paradox of a widespread thirst for spirituality and, at the same time, a prevailing secular ethos. From another perspective, the nation finds itself more intensely called to build a “civilization of life and love,” even as it struggles against a “culture of death.” In United States society at large, many persons are unchurched or unaffiliated with any denomination or faith tradition but remain open to evangelization. So too, there is a growing number of persons, particularly young people, who are unchurched and who have rejected religious beliefs as irrelevant to their lives.</li>
        <li>Weaknesses of ethical standards and a moral relativism have a corrosive effect on American public life as seen, for example, in marriage and family life, in business, and in politics.</li>
        <li>The redefinition of marriage in culture and civil law and shifting understandings of gender and sexuality have transformed society such that the anthropological presuppositions that were once commonly shared are being called into question, making it more difficult for the seeds of the Gospel to take root and sprout.</li>
        <li>Advances in technology have brought great progress to humanity but at the same time present new challenges.<span class="footnumber">24</span><span class="footnote">“The gift of discernment has become all the more necessary today, since contemporary life offers immense possibilities for action and distraction, and the world presents all of them as valid and good. All of us, but especially the young, are immersed in a culture of zapping. We can navigate simultaneously on two or more screens and interact at the same time with two or three virtual scenarios. Without the wisdom of discernment, we can easily become prey to every passing trend.” <i>Gaudete et Exsultate</i>, no. 167. See also <i>Laudato Si</i>’, no. 47; Pope Benedict XVI, Vespers Homily, Pastoral Visit to Lamezia Terme and Serra San Bruno, October 9, 2011, w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/homilies/2011/documents/hf_benxvi_ hom_20111009_vespri-serra-san-bruno.html (accessed May 5, 2018).</span> These challenges are particularly present to young adults, who seem alienated from any authority or institution and who are accustomed to virtual relationships and constant recourse to social media. In addition, the widespread availability of pornography on the internet is a pervasive reality and a pernicious threat to human and moral development.</li>
      </ol>
      </p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="21">§21 </span>(2) Second, many factors within the Catholic Church in the United States also present opportunities and challenges that directly affect seminary formation:
      <ol type="a">
        <li>The Catholic Church in the United States is reinvigorated especially by the new ecclesial realities born of the Second Vatican Council, which have offered a more positive context for vocations.</li>
        <li>With a renewed sense of mission, the Church wants to engage in the new evangelization in these areas: evangelization through ordinary pastoral ministry, evangelization through ministry to the baptized who lack a relationship with the Church, and evangelization to those who do not yet know Jesus Christ or who have rejected him.<span class="footnumber">25</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Evangelii Gaudium</i>, no. 15.</span></li>
        <li>The Catholic Church in the United States continues to be firmly committed to and engaged in ecumenical and interreligious dialogue and cooperation, something that “belongs to the very essence of” the community of the Lord’s disciples.<span class="footnumber">26</span><span class="footnote">St. John Paul II, Ut Unum Sint (On Commitment to Ecumenism, 1995), no. 9, <a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_25051995_ut-unum-sint.html" target="blank">www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_25051995_ut-unum-sint.html</a>.</span></li>
        <li>Globalization has underscored the need for greater coordination and deeper communion with the Church in other parts of the world. <i>Ecclesia in America</i> bears witness to this reality and responsibility, especially in our own hemisphere.</li>
        <li>The ministerial collaboration of priests with bishops, other priests, deacons, men and women in consecrated life, and lay men and women is an important feature of the life of the Church in the United States.</li>
        <li>The important presence and unique contribution of women in society and in the Church need to be acknowledged and nurtured. They offer an edifying example of humility, generosity, and selfless service.<span class="footnumber">27</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 151.</span></li>
        <li>The demographics of the Catholic Church in the United States demonstrate the challenging situation of fewer priests and a large Catholic population.</li>
        <li>There are large numbers of inactive or “semi-active” Catholics, as well as poorly catechized Catholics, who need to be called back to active participation in the life of the Church and, as needed, full initiation.</li>
        <li>The cultural acceptance of the individual’s right to exploration and expression of differences of belief brings Catholics in the United States into continuing and sometimes significant differences between their perceptions and the reality of what is essential to Catholic belief. These differences in perception strain many dimensions of the life of the Church and diminish the impact of the mission of the Church on society.</li>
        <li>Within the Church, clericalism and abuse of power have had a corrosive effect. The scandalous and criminal behavior of some clergy who have abused minors and engaged in sexual misconduct with adults, including seminarians, has caused great suffering for the victims and damaged the Church’s witness in society. This scandal has resulted in a loss of credibility for the Church and an overall lack of respect for religion. Both the nation and the Church are summoned to renewal and to a greater integrity of life. The <i>Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People and the Essential Norms for Diocesan/Eparchial Policies Dealing with Allegations of Sexual Abuse of Minors by Priests or Deacons</i> adopted by the Catholic bishops in the United States in 2002 (revised in 2005, 2011, and 2018) provide an example of moving in this direction. Also providing a way forward are the apostolic letter motu proprio of Pope Francis titled <i>Vos Estis Lux Mundi</i> (<i>You Are the Light of the World</i>) and the documents adopted at the USCCB’s June 2019 general assembly.<span class="footnumber">28</span><span class="footnote">See USCCB, “Directives for the Implementation of the Provisions of <i>Vos Estis Lux Mundi</i> Concerning Bishops and their Equivalents,” “Acknowledging Our Episcopal Commitments,” and “Protocol Regarding Available Non-Penal Restrictions on Bishops,” in A Continuous and Profound Conversion of Hearts (Washington, DC: USCCB, 2019), 9-21.</span></li>
      </ol>
      </p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="22">§22 </span>(3) Finally, the Church in the United States continues to benefit from the blessings that the variety of men in initial formation for priesthood bring. They also, as in every age, bring some unique challenges as well. The background of men preparing for priestly ministry also forms an important context for priestly formation in the United States.
      <ol type="a">
        <li>They may be, for example, the following:</li>
        <ol type="i">
          <li>Men who are older and who bring previous life and work experiences</li>
          <li>Men born outside the United States who speak English as a second language</li>
          <li>Men whose faith has been rediscovered and rekindled in a powerful way through significant religious experiences, and men who are converts to Catholicism</li>
          <li>Men born and raised in the United States who find themselves struggling intensely with particular cultural counterpoints to the Gospel, especially regarding sexual permissiveness, the drive to acquire and consume material resources, utilitarianism, and the exaltation of freedom as merely personal and individual autonomy, divorced from personal responsibility and objective moral standards</li>
        </ol>
        <li>An increasing number of priestly vocations now come from diverse and sometimes dysfunctional family situations.</li>

Members of the seminary community who are involved in the process of priestly formation must adhere to these teachings. The priest is called to serve the great work of evangelization which Christ has entrusted to his Bride, the Church.</p>
      <blockquote>Without priests the Church would not be able to live that fundamental obedience which is at the very heart of her existence and her mission in history, an obedience in response to the command of Christ: “Go therefore and make disciples of all nations” (Mt 28:19) and “Do this in remembrance of me” (Lk 22:19; cf. 1 Cor 11:24), i.e., an obedience to the command to announce the Gospel and to renew daily the sacrifice of the giving of his body and the shedding of his blood for the life of the world.<span class="footnumber">30</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 1.</span></blockquote>

    <div class="content">
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="24">§24 </span>The mission of the priest flows from his identity. The identity of the priest, like that of every Christian, is fundamentally rooted in a relationship with the Trinity. “It is within the Church’s mystery, as a mystery of Trinitarian communion in missionary tension, that every Christian identity is revealed, and likewise the specific identity of the priest and his ministry.”<span class="footnumber">31</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 12.</span></p>
      <blockquote>Indeed, the priest, by virtue of the consecration which he receives in the sacrament of orders, is sent forth by the Father through the mediatorship of Jesus Christ, to whom he is configured in a special way as head and shepherd of his people, in order to live and work by the power of the Holy Spirit in service of the Church and for the salvation of the world. . . . Consequently, the nature and mission of the ministerial priesthood cannot be defined except through this multiple and rich interconnection of relationships which arise from the Blessed Trinity and are prolonged in the communion of the Church, as a sign and instrument of Christ, of communion with God and of the unity of all humanity.<span class="footnumber">32</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 12.</span></blockquote>
      <p>The Church has “a responsibility to be a living sign of the Father’s love in the world,”<span class="footnumber">33</span><span class="footnote"><i>Misericordiae Vultus</i>, no. 4.</span> a responsibility which the priest assumes as his own upon ordination.

    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible title2">Christological Nature</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="25">§25 </span>For the priest to understand his identity, he must understand two central relations: his relationship with Christ, the Son of the Father, and his relationship with the Church. The primary point of reference for priestly identity is Christ himself: “The priest finds the full truth of his identity in being a derivation, a specific participation in and continuation of Christ himself, the one high priest of the new and eternal covenant. The priest is the living and transparent image of Christ the priest.”<span class="footnumber">35</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 12.</span> As priests “are configured to Christ, Head and Shepherd, Servant and Spouse,”<span class="footnumber">36</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 35.</span> they</p>
      <blockquote>are called to prolong the presence of Christ, the One High Priest, embodying his way of life and making him visible in the midst of the flock entrusted to their care. . . . In the Church and on behalf of the Church, priests are a sacramental representation of Jesus Christ— the head and shepherd—authoritatively proclaiming his word, repeating his acts of forgiveness and his offer of salvation—particularly in baptism, penance, and the Eucharist, showing his loving concern to the point of a total gift of self for the flock, which they gather into unity and lead to the Father through Christ and in the Spirit. In a word, priests exist and act in order to proclaim the Gospel to the world and to build up the Church in the name and person of Christ the head and shepherd.<span class="footnumber">37</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 15.</span></blockquote>
      <p>Calling to mind the image of the suffering servant (Is 53:4ff.), we are reminded that priestly ministers are called to embody the life of Christ, who accepted suffering and death as part of his mission to bring salvation to the whole world.<span class="footnumber">38</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Lumen Gentium</i>, nos. 14-16.</span> Because the priest is objectively configured to Christ through ordination, he must seek to make a personal gift of his life in response to this consecration.<span class="footnumber">39</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 39.</span> The sacramental configuration to Christ the Servant was also conferred on the priest at his diaconate ordination. This configuration is not lost when he is ordained a priest but rather continues in imitation of Christ, who came not “to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many” (Mt 20:28).</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="26">§26 </span>Finally, Christ is the Bridegroom, a title which “expresses the truth about the love of God who ‘first loved us’ (cf. 1 Jn 4:19) and who, with the gift generated by this spousal love for man, has exceeded all human expectations: ‘He loved them to the end’ (Jn 13:1).”<span class="footnumber">40</span><span class="footnote">St. John Paul II, Mulieris Dignitatem (On the Dignity and the Vocation of Women on the Occasion of the Marian Year, 1988), no. 25, <a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/apost_letters/1988/documents/hf_jp-ii_ apl_19880815_mulieris-dignitatem.html" target="blank">www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/apost_letters/1988/documents/hf_jp-ii_ apl_19880815_mulieris-dignitatem.html</a>.</span> “Hence Christ stands ‘before’ the Church and ‘nourishes and cherishes her’ (Eph 5:29), giving his life for her. The priest is called to be the living image of Jesus Christ, the spouse of the Church. Of course, he will always remain a member of the community as a believer alongside his other brothers and sisters who have been called by the Spirit, but in virtue of his configuration to Christ, the Head and Shepherd, the priest stands in this spousal relationship with regard to the community.”<span class="footnumber">41</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 22.</span></p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="27">§27 </span>This Christological foundation is particularly important for the life of the celibate priest. By the grace of the virtue of celibate chastity, a priest is a sign of the chastity of Christ. Formation for living priestly celibacy should take the chastity of Christ as a point of reference at every stage in all of its dimensions. As Pope Benedict XVI affirms, “The fact that Christ himself, the eternal priest, lived his mission even to the sacrifice of the Cross in the state of virginity constitutes the sure point of reference for understanding the meaning of the tradition of [priestly celibacy in] the Latin Church.”<span class="footnumber">42</span><span class="footnote"><i>Sacramentum Caritatis</i>, no. 24.</span></p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible title2">Ecclesiological Nature</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="28">§28 </span>The second point of reference for priestly identity, following the priest’s relationship with Christ, is his relationship to the Church. “As a mystery, the Church is essentially related to Jesus Christ. She is his fullness, his body, his spouse.”<span class="footnumber">43</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 12.</span> The priest’s specific configuration to Christ brings about this special relationship to his Body, the Church. Within the Body, he represents Christ, Head and Shepherd, Servant and Spouse, as a co-worker with the bishop. The nature and mission of the ministerial priesthood can only be fully understood within the mystery of the Church, “as a service to the glory of God and to the brothers and sisters in their baptismal priesthood.”<span class="footnumber">44</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 31.</span> “The ministry of the priest,” then, “is entirely on behalf of the Church; it aims at promoting the exercise of the common priesthood of the entire People of God.”<span class="footnumber">45</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 16.</span> To understand who he is, and therefore how he should live, the priest must understand himself in relationship with the Church. His participation in Christ’s priesthood is called “ministerial” precisely for its service to the members of the Body.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="29">§29 </span><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i> expands our understanding of the ecclesiological scope of the ministerial priesthood by noting that it “is ordered not only to the particular Church but also to the universal Church, in communion with the bishop, with Peter and under Peter. Through the priesthood of the bishop, the priesthood of the second order is incorporated in the apostolic structure of the Church. In this way priests, like the Apostles, act as ambassadors of Christ (cf. 2 Cor 5:20). This is the basis of the missionary character of every priest.”<span class="footnumber">46</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 16.</span></p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible title2">Priesthood in Presbyteral Communion</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="30">§30 </span>These Trinitarian, Christological, and ecclesiological dimensions give us a sense of the nature, mission, and ministry of priests. It is important, however, to add that these dimensions only become real and operative in a presbyterate, one that is in communion with its bishop. “By its very nature, the ordained ministry can be carried out only to the extent that the priest is united to Christ through sacramental participation in the priestly order, and thus to the extent that he is in hierarchical communion with his own bishop. The ordained ministry has a radical ‘communitarian form’ and can only be carried out as a ‘collective work.’”<span class="footnumber">47</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 17.</span> This “communitarian form” also means that priests are to develop and foster bonds of fraternity and cooperation among themselves, so that the reality of the presbyterate may take hold of their lives.<span class="footnumber">48</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Presbyterorum Ordinis</i>, no. 8; CIC, c. 275 §1; CCEO, c. 379.</span> Furthermore, seminaries and houses of initial formation are encouraged to foster mutual relations among members of institutes of consecrated life, societies of apostolic life, and seminarians in formation for the diocesan priesthood, so as to lay the foundation for a spirit of unity among future priests and ministers of the Church.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="31">§31 </span>Priestly ministry, whether lived out in a particular Church or in an institute of consecrated life or society of apostolic life, can appear to be very different: one more geographically and parishbound, the other wider-ranging and rooted in a particular charism. Still, all priests share a common ministerial priesthood, belong to a presbyterate in communion with the diocesan bishop, and serve the same mission of the Church.<span class="footnumber">49</span><span class="footnote">“It is of great importance that all priests, whether diocesan or regular [religious], should help each other, so that they may be fellow-helpers of the truth. Each is joined to the rest of the members of this priestly body by special ties of apostolic charity of ministry and of brotherhood.” <i>Presbyterorum Ordinis</i>, no. 8.</span> A common sacramental bond links all priests, although particular circumstances of ministry and life may be diverse. It is, therefore, essential for all priests and those in priestly formation to understand and to see themselves as engaged in the Church’s ministry, subject to the same formation laid out in the Program of Priestly Formation.<span class="footnumber">50</span><span class="footnote">This means not only that diocesan priests form a presbyterate, but that “religious clergy who live and work in a particular church also belong to the one presbyterate, albeit under a different title.” <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 74.</span> Depending on the type of ecclesiastical entity, the details for the stages of formation may differ. For example, the propaedeutic stage for institutes of consecrated life or societies of apostolic life is handled by the postulancy or novitiate. In all cases the applicant, postulant, and so on must meet the benchmarks as noted in each dimension later in this document.</p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible title2">Priesthood: A Journey of Discipleship</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="32">§32 </span>Discipleship is a lifelong journey of following Jesus Christ; this is certainly the case for the priest. Throughout his initial and ongoing formation, he continually learns to listen more attentively to the voice of the Master who calls him. Thus, formation serves him best when it can be experienced as an ever-advancing journey of conversion and growth. Gradually, as a disciple on this journey, he is able to make decisions that are permanent and that he will always be called upon to deepen and expand. The first stage of initial formation is the propaedeutic stage. During this stage, the man is introduced to the life of the Church as a community in which excellence of character is nurtured, to the practice of daily participation in the Holy Mass, to love for Sacred Scripture, to the prayer of the Church (the Divine Office, or the Divine Praises in the Eastern Catholic Churches), and to the basic elements of the Christian faith as he discerns attentively and purposefully his potential vocation to priesthood in the presence of a supportive community of fellow seminarians and formators. This community is an ideal environment for growth in self-knowledge. In the discipleship stage, systematic formation as a disciple of Jesus Christ is the aim. The seminarian develops his principal strengths and grows to identify, acknowledge, and begin to overcome his shortcomings. In the configuration stage, the seminarian hones his capacity to serve and become a man for others. In the vocational synthesis stage<span class="footnumber">51</span><span class="footnote">Throughout this document the term “vocational synthesis” is used to identify the last stage of initial formation, described in the <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i> as “the ‘pastoral stage’ or ‘stage of vocational synthesis.’” <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 57.</span> the transitional deacon experiences a life of self-giving in a pastoral setting, as he begins the transition to full-time ministry.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="33">§33 </span>This journey of discipleship and growth in Christian faith and service continues after ordination with ongoing formation, in which the ordained priest seeks an ever-deepening conformity to Christ under the guidance of the diocesan bishop or competent authority of the institute of consecrated life or society of apostolic life and in fraternal communion with the diocesan presbyterate and, in the case of nondiocesan priests, the presbyterate within his community.<span class="footnumber">52</span><span class="footnote">“Every priest should always feel that he is a disciple on a journey, constantly needing an integrated formation, understood as a continuous configuration to Christ.” <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, Introduction, no. 3.</span></p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="34">§34 </span>The human, spiritual, intellectual, and pastoral dimensions of formation are present in each stage and “must be seen through a unifying lens. . . . Together, these dimensions give shape and structure to the identity of the seminarian and the priest, and make him capable of that ‘gift of self to the Church,’ which is the essence of pastoral charity. The entire journey of formation must never be reduced to a single aspect to the detriment of others, but it must always be an integrated journey of the disciple called to priesthood.”<span class="footnumber">53</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, Introduction, no. 3.</span></p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="35">§35 </span>Community is an integral aspect of formation.<span class="footnumber">54</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, Introduction, no. 3.</span> The gift of vocation appears in a Christian community; it is fostered and developed in the seminary community, with a view to serving the People of God in the community of the presbyterate.<span class="footnumber">55</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, Introduction, no. 3.</span> The community of formators serves as a living model for the wider seminary community by “sharing a common responsibility, with due regard to the duties and the office entrusted to each member.”<span class="footnumber">56</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, Introduction, no. 3.</span></p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="36">§36 </span>Finally, the missionary aspect of formation emerges from the ecclesial dimension of the ministerial priesthood, directed toward the growth of the Church. “Formation is clearly missionary in character. Its goal is participation in the one mission entrusted by Christ to His Church, that is evangelization, in all its forms.”<span class="footnumber">57</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, Introduction, no. 3.</span></p>

  <div class="content">
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="37">§37 </span>When the Second Vatican Council’s decree <i>Presbyterorum Ordinis</i> speaks of “the life of priests,” it refers to the whole of their existence but especially to the spiritual dimension that is at the center of all life. In a world that is increasingly secular in its outlook, it is especially important to note and hold fast to the one necessary thing (see Lk 10:42).</p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="38">§38 </span>Along with all the baptized who have been given new life in Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit, priests are called with their brothers and sisters to live out their baptismal call as disciples of Jesus Christ and to grow in holiness.<span class="footnumber">58</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Lumen Gentium</i>, nos. 39-42; <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 20; CIC, c. 210; and CCEO, c. 13.</span> While growth in discipleship is a lifelong journey, seminary formation is a privileged time for the future priest to discover that he is a “mystery to himself.”<span class="footnumber">59</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 28.</span> He will need to discover his talents and gifts and to recognize his limits and frailty, so that “the vocation to the priesthood does not become imprisoned in an abstract ideal, nor run the risk of reducing itself to a merely practical and organizational activism, removed from the conscience of the person.”<span class="footnumber">60</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 43.</span></p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="39">§39 </span>At the same time, priests are called to a specific vocation to holiness in virtue of their new consecration in the Sacrament of Holy Orders, a consecration that configures them to Christ the Head and Shepherd, Servant and Spouse. This configuration to Christ, a sacramental character effected by the Holy Spirit, prepares the priest for the mission and ministry which is specific to him<span class="footnumber">61</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Catechism of the Catholic Church</i>, no. 1563.</span> and which obliges him to be a “living instrument of Christ the eternal priest” and to act “in the name and in the person of Christ himself” and with his entire “life,” called to witness in a fundamental way to the “radicalism of the Gospel.”<span class="footnumber">62</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 20.</span></p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="40">§40 </span>For priests, the specific arena in which their spiritual life unfolds is their exercise of ministry in fulfillment of their mission.<span class="footnumber">63</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 24; <i>Presbyterorum Ordinis</i>, no. 12; Synod of Bishops, The Ministerial Priesthood and Justice in the World (1971), part 2, I, iii.</span> The life of priests in the Spirit means their continuous transformation and conversion of heart centered on the integration or linking of their <i>identity</i> as configured to Christ, Head and Shepherd, Servant and Spouse, with their <i>ministry</i> of Word, Sacrament, and pastoral governance (leadership).<span class="footnumber">64</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, nos. 24-26.</span> “In contemplating the Lord, who offered His life for others, he will be able to give himself generously and with self-sacrifice for the People of God.”<span class="footnumber">65</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 41.</span> He will more closely imitate Jesus, who came to serve and not to be served.</p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="41">§41 </span>The ministry itself, by which the priest brings Christ’s redemptive gifts to his people, transforms the priest’s own life. In a particular way, the celebrations of the sacraments lead the priest to a holy encounter with God’s all-transforming, merciful love.</p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="42">§42 </span>When the priest’s identity as sacramentally configured to Christ culminates in his ministry on behalf of Christ, which is called <i>amoris officium</i> (a work of love), he finds his unity of life in pastoral charity. “Priests will achieve the unity of their lives by joining themselves with Christ in the recognition of the Father’s will and in the gift of themselves to the flock entrusted to them. In this way, by adopting the role of the good shepherd they will find in the practice of pastoral charity itself the bond of priestly perfection which will reduce to unity their life and activity.”<span class="footnumber">66</span><span class="footnote"><i>Presbyterorum Ordinis</i>, no. 14.</span></p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="43">§43 </span>Priestly life lived in configuration to Jesus Christ must necessarily manifest and give witness to the radicalism of the Gospel. In other words, priests are called to a way of life that gives evident and transparent witness to the power of the Gospel at work in their lives. A life of continual conversion allows the priest to become and remain “a ‘man of discernment,’ able to read the reality of human life in the light of the Spirit. In this way he will be able to choose, decide and act according to the will of God.”<span class="footnumber">67</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 43.</span> The elements of such a lifestyle—named here and to be developed elsewhere in this document—include the following:

    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="44">§44 </span>The diocesan priest entrusted with the care of souls in many ways normally serves in parochial ministry. In the parish he will encounter the day-to-day joys and sorrows of the faithful as he accompanies them throughout life, continually leading them to encounter Christ. This art of accompaniment, which develops in the heart of the seminarian and continues to deepen in the heart of the priest, allows him lovingly to accompany the flock entrusted to him; he thus becomes a spiritual father to his people.</p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="45">§45 </span>The life of priests in religious institutes and societies of apostolic life encompasses everything that has been said about the life of priests generally. It also adds to the exercise of the ministerial priesthood the distinctive aspects of a religious institute’s Rule of Life or of the constitution of a society of apostolic life. These aspects include the spirituality of the institute or society, common life, and distinctive apostolates that witness to the community’s charism as a gift of the Spirit to the Church. Priestly formation for those men belonging to a form of consecrated life must therefore always situate the vocation to the priesthood within the charism and thus reference the spirituality, history, and mission of the particular institute of consecrated life or society of apostolic life, with fidelity to its founder, the institute’s or society’s mission, and the Church which receives that charism.</p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="46">§46 </span>The primary context of priesthood for members of an institute of consecrated life or society of apostolic life ordinarily comes from the nature of the life itself as a deepening and fulfillment of a baptismal commitment to Christ by observing the evangelical counsels in an institute of consecrated life or a society of apostolic life approved by the Church.<span class="footnumber">82</span><span class="footnote">“By the profession of the evangelical counsels the characteristic features of Jesus—the chaste, poor and obedient one—are made constantly ‘visible’ in the midst of the world and the eyes of the faithful are directed towards the mystery of the Kingdom of God already at work in history, even as it awaits its full realization in heaven.” <i>Vita Consecrata</i>, no. 1.</span> Those men belonging to an institute of consecrated life or society of apostolic life who are called to priesthood exercise that ministry within the context of their institute or society. “In reality, the charism of the religious life, far from being an impulse born of flesh and blood or one derived from a mentality which conforms itself to the modern world, is the fruit of the Holy Spirit, who is always at work within the Church.”<span class="footnumber">83</span><span class="footnote"><i>Evangelica Testificatio</i>, no. 11.</span> The exercise of priesthood takes on a distinctive quality for a man who belongs to an institute of consecrated life or a society of apostolic life, depending upon the Rule of Life, constitution, and charism of a particular institute or society. Nevertheless, the priest always exercises his ministry in union with the diocesan bishop as his co-worker.<span class="footnumber">84</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 35.</span></p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="47">§47 </span>To a great extent, the deeper identification of those in consecrated life with the charism of their community’s founder is due to their obedience to the directives of the Second Vatican Council. “The up-todate renewal of the religious life comprises both a constant return to the sources of the whole of the Christian life and to the primitive inspiration of the institutes, and their adaptation to the changed conditions of our time.”<span class="footnumber">85</span><span class="footnote"><i>Perfectae Caritatis</i>, no. 2.</span></p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="48">§48 </span>Centuries of tradition bear witness to a difference between formation for the consecrated life and formation of seminarians for the priesthood. Formation for the consecrated life ordinarily precedes formation for priestly ministry—as an institute of consecrated life or society of apostolic life joyfully accepts its responsibility to form a man into its charism, and as the man owns and expresses the joy of the Gospel in the Rule of Life of the institute or constitution of the society—and accompanies a man in deepening his desire to serve Christ through ministerial priesthood. Aspects of formation to the priesthood that are addressed in the propaedeutic stage are addressed within early stages of consecrated life, that is, candidacy, postulancy, novitiate, and the time of temporary profession when a foundation is laid for public witness to the evangelical counsels as expressed in a particular institute or society. Nevertheless, the religious institute or society of apostolic life also assumes responsibility for forming the man for Holy Orders according to the mind of the Church and thus recognizing the human, spiritual, intellectual, and pastoral requirements incumbent upon all who are called to ministerial priesthood, and how these exist in addition to the formation for the consecrated life itself.</p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="49">§49 </span>This <i>Program of Priestly Formation</i> outlines the requirements shared by diocesan seminarians and by the men in formation for priesthood who are members of an institute of consecrated life or society of apostolic life, while recognizing the different process of formation incumbent both upon those whose primary call is to be of service to the Church through consecrated life, in a fidelity and witness to the charism of their founder in the gift that is shared,<span class="footnumber">86</span><span class="footnote">See Sacred Congregation for Religious and for Secular Institutes/Sacred Congregation for Bishops, Mutuae Relationes (Directives for the Mutual Relations Between Bishops and Religious in the Church, 1978); Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, Directives on Formation in Religious Institutes (1990).</span> and upon those whose primary call is to be of Christlike service to the Catholic faithful through a commitment in obedience, simplicity of life, celibacy, and holiness.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="50">§50 </span>The whole Church receives and accompanies the gift of vocations from God and is responsible for promoting and discerning vocations.<span class="footnumber">87</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, nos. 34-41.</span> The entire Church is to be engaged in the pastoral work of promoting vocations.<span class="footnumber">88</span><span class="footnote">See CIC, c. 233 §1; CCEO, c. 329.</span> It is integral to the mission of the Church “to care for the birth, discernment and fostering of vocations, particularly those to the priesthood.”<span class="footnumber">89</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 34.</span> Within that ecclesial context, there are various responsibilities.
      <ol type="a">
        <li><i>The Church</i>: The whole Church through prayer, active cooperation, and the witness of living full Christian lives takes responsibility for vocations.<span class="footnumber">90</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 41.</span> “Both the family and the parish of origin, or the parish to which he belongs, as well as other ecclesial communities, contribute significantly to sustaining and nourishing the vocation of those called to the priesthood.”<span class="footnumber">91</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 148.</span></li>
        <li><i>The family</i>: “A very special responsibility falls upon the Christian family, which by virtue of the sacrament of matrimony shares in its own unique way in the educational mission of the Church— teacher and mother.” Families can become “‘a first seminary’ in which children can acquire from the beginning an awareness of piety and prayer and love for the Church.”<span class="footnumber">92</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 41.</span></li>
        <li><i>The parish</i>: The parish is where vocations are first explored and nourished in the faith and where those who are called come into contact with the clergy, men and women in consecrated life, and lay leaders who accompany them on this journey and encourage them into service. It is vital that the parish develop a culture of vocations to invite youth, young adults, and adults to consider the calls to marriage, the priesthood, the permanent diaconate, and consecrated life. Catholic schools and parish religious education programs are supportive environments that foster intellectual curiosity and encourage the development of love of God and neighbor. Rooted in the teachings of the Catholic faith, schools and programs provide an invaluable setting in which vocations to marriage, priesthood, and consecrated life can be nurtured.</li>
        <li><i>The diocesan bishop</i>: “The first responsibility for the pastoral work of promoting priestly vocations lies with the bishop, who is called to be the first to exercise this responsibility even though he can and must call upon many others to cooperate with him.”<span class="footnumber">93</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 41.</span> Although he shares his responsibility, the pastoral task of promoting priestly vocations remains his task, for which he must continue to offer supervision and direct involvement.<span class="footnumber">94</span><span class="footnote">See CIC, cc. 233, 385; CCEO, cc. 195, 329 §1, 3°; Congregation for Bishops, Apostolorum Successores (Directory for the Pastoral Ministry of Bishops, 2004), no. 91.</span> As the one responsible for the unity of the local Church and its communion with the Universal Church, the bishop, especially in the context of the United States, must encourage a wide range of men who represent the cultural and linguistic diversity of his ecclesiastical entity.</li>
        <li><i>The presbyterate</i>: “The bishop can rely above all on the cooperation of his presbyterate. All its priests are united to him and share his responsibility in seeking and fostering priestly vocations.”<span class="footnumber">95</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 41.</span> They do this by inviting men to consider the priesthood as a possible vocation. For those who are discerning the call, priests can nurture their sense of vocation and be invaluable mentors, accompanying them along the path of discernment. Through their priestly ministry, especially in parish assignments, priests are able to recognize the prayerfulness, the talents, and the character of men who may be called to priestly ministry. “At the same time the diligence of priests in carrying out their Eucharistic ministry, together with the conscious, active and fruitful participation of the faithful in the Eucharist, provides young men with a powerful example and incentive for responding generously to God’s call. Often it is the example of a priest’s fervent pastoral charity which the Lord uses to sow and to bring to fruition in a young man’s heart the seed of a priestly calling.”<span class="footnumber">96</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ecclesia de Eucharistia</i>, no. 31.</span></li>
        <li><i>The vocation director</i>: In ecclesiastical entities in the United States, generally there is a vocation director (or team) who serves on behalf of the diocesan bishop and presbyterate or of the competent authority to promote vocations (the work of recruitment) and to direct those discerning a call to the priesthood.</li>
        <ol type="i">
          <li>The diocesan vocation director supports, inspires, and equips pastors, parishes, and diocesan personnel to create a culture of vocations in which men can be better equipped to answer God’s prompting. Pastors and other members of the community are invaluable in assisting the vocation director in accompanying discerners along the path of discipleship and mission. Once a discerner has been identified, the vocation director works in conjunction with the parish or another community of the faithful to assist in nourishing the seeds of a vocation with divine grace, for example by helping the man to find a spiritual director, maintain an active prayer life, develop a network of relationships with others who bring forth fruits of authentic discernment in one another, and actively seek out a solid participation in the mission of the parish or other community of the faithful. It is important that the vocation director actively develop relationships by his presence, such as regular visits to parishes, youth groups, young adult gatherings, and university campus ministry events.</li>
          <li>In cooperating with the formation process, a diocesan vocation director may manage the diocesan process of admission, serve as a liaison between the diocesan bishop and the seminary, and link the seminarian to the diocese and presbyterate, for example, through pastoral placements. He collaborates with the bishop, with the presbyterate, with a diocesan vocation commission if one is in place, and with the seminary. The role of a vocation director for other ecclesiastical entities may vary according to the division of labor in a given ecclesiastical entity. All vocation directors should collaborate to create a culture of vocations. In all cases, the relationship with the seminary merits special attention. Mutual respect and collaboration should mark the relations between vocation and seminary personnel. Each possesses different responsibilities; yet cooperation, mutual knowledge, and trust are vital for the good of the seminarians and the benefit of the Church. Such collaboration is especially important concerning applicants’ ongoing evaluation and their recommendation for admission.</li>
          <li>The vocation director accompanies others along their journey, possibly for several years, through their initial discernment, seminary formation, and ordination to the priesthood, if that is the local custom. The vocation director should not attempt to develop a process of formation that competes with or parallels that of the seminary. It is vital that all those responsible for the formation of priests collaborate fully in this work. Regardless of the length of the relationship, the vocation director has a lasting influence on the lives of those he encounters.</li>
        </ol>
        <li><i>National vocations promotion</i>: Peer organizations such as the National Conference of Diocesan Vocation Directors (NCDVD) and the National Religious Vocation Conference (NRVC) seek to promote vocations to priesthood in various ecclesiastical entities, as well the other various expressions of consecrated life. Each in its own way is a resource to vocations personnel, formators, seminaries, parishes, dioceses, eparchies, personal ordinariates, schools, universities, and those discerning a priestly vocation or a vocation to the various forms of consecrated life. This exchange of ideas, sharing of resources, and development of best practices in promotion, discernment, and formation help those involved in vocational accompaniment. Organizations such as NCDVD and NRVC help members to build fraternity and support, learn from one another, and serve the discerner and seminarian with the best resources available.</li>
        <li><i>The seminary:</i> The seminary plays a collaborative role in the promotion of vocations and an important role in the discernment of vocations. A seminary attached to a particular diocese often subsumes the responsibilities of a diocesan vocation director. The seminary community is especially important in promoting, assessing, and developing priestly vocations.</li>
        <li><i>Seminarians</i>: Seminarians also play a significant role in promoting priestly vocations through the friendships they form outside the seminary setting, through their visible presence in their home parishes, through their involvement in Christian service activities and field education, through their assistance with vocation programs, and through the welcome they extend to visitors at the seminary.</li>

    <div class="content">
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="51">§51 </span>Discerners for the priesthood must be in prayerful dialogue with God and with the Church in the discernment of their vocation. The linkage of this divine and ecclesial dialogue is especially important because “in the present context there is . . . a certain tendency to view the bond between human beings and God in an individualistic and self-centered way, as if God’s call reached the individual by a direct route, without in any way passing through the community.”<span class="footnumber">97</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 37.</span> It may be difficult to heed the voice of God in our world of constant distraction.<span class="footnumber">98</span><span class="footnote">“Nowadays listening is becoming more and more difficult, immersed as we are in a society full of noise, overstimulated and bombarded by information. The outer noise that sometimes prevails in our cities and our neighborhoods is often accompanied by our interior dispersion and confusion. This prevents us from pausing and enjoying the taste of contemplation, reflecting serenely on the events of our lives, going about our work with confidence in God’s loving plan, and making a fruitful discernment.” Pope Francis, Message for the 2018 World Day of Vocations, December 3, 2017, <a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/messages/vocations/documents/papa-francesco_20171203_55-messaggio-giornata-mondiale-vocazioni.html" target="blank">www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/messages/vocations/documents/papa-francesco_20171203_55-messaggio-giornata-mondiale-vocazioni.html</a>.</span> Today’s reality makes the role of the vocation director for any ecclesiastical entity essential in helping someone discern a call to the priesthood.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="52">§52 </span>It is important for the vocation director, as much as possible, to enter into dialogue with the discerner and accompany him in this process. Listening is important as well: “Listening, in communication, is an openness of heart which makes possible that closeness without which genuine spiritual encounter cannot occur. Listening helps us to find the right gesture and word which shows that we are more than simply bystanders. Only through such respectful and compassionate listening can we enter on the paths of true growth and awaken a yearning for the Christian ideal: the desire to respond fully to God’s love and to bring to fruition what he has sown in our lives.”<span class="footnumber">99</span><span class="footnote"><i>Evangelii Gaudium</i>, no. 171.</span> Although he does not serve as a spiritual director for the discerners in his care, the vocation director should have training in sound principles of vocational discernment to be able to assist them in their discernment in the external forum. A joyful witness by the vocation director makes the reality of the priesthood attractive to the one who is called to this vocation. For all discerners, listening and personal accompaniment are critical.</p>

      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="53">§53 </span>As the Church in the United States continues to become increasingly Hispanic, promotion and discernment of vocations in this segment of the Catholic population of the United States is essential, as are vocation promotion and discernment in other populations present in an ecclesiastical entity.<span class="footnumber">100</span><span class="footnote">For more information on culturally diverse populations in the Catholic Church in the United States, see Mark Gray, Mary Gautier, and Thomas Gaunt, SJ, Cultural Diversity in the Catholic Church in the United States (Washington, DC: Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate, 2014).</span> At this historical moment, particular attention should be given to US-born Hispanics, who constitute the majority of young people within this population.<span class="footnumber">101</span><span class="footnote">See USCCB, V National Encuentro of Hispanic/Latino Ministry Working Document (Washington, DC: USCCB, 2018), 150-155.</span> It may be desirable that a vocation director himself be able to speak Spanish and be well acquainted with specific Hispanic cultures present in his ecclesiastical entity, because vocations recruitment in these cultures often entails building relationships not only with discerners but also with their families. Vocation directors and admission boards must embrace a missionary spirit in their own ecclesiastical entity, with the goal of encountering Hispanics where they are and accompanying them on their discernment journeys. Such commitment sometimes requires offering academic assistance, counseling, and tutoring to help those discerning a priestly call to prepare for formation. Pastoral leaders and communities fostering vocations among Hispanics must be attentive to cultural differences, which will vary greatly across the broad segment of the Hispanic Catholic population in the United States.</p>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible title1">ADMISSION INTO A FORMATION PROGRAM</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="55">§55 </span>In contrast to previous generations, when a more homogenous population presented itself for entrance to the seminary, today’s applicants represent considerable diversity—not only of personal gifts and levels of maturity but also of significant cultural differences—that must be taken into account. All those involved in the evaluation of applicants for priestly formation must appreciate cultural, generational, educational, and familial differences and be able to recognize which are gifts, which are liabilities, and which are simply indications of a need for further growth.</p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="56">§56 </span>Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the diocesan bishop or major superior of the institute of consecrated life or society of apostolic life to decide whether to admit applicants into priestly formation, in accordance with the criteria which have been properly established.<span class="footnumber">103</span><span class="footnote">See CIC, c. 241 §1.</span> The diocesan bishop or major superior of the institute of consecrated life or society of apostolic life shares his responsibility with the vocation director or vocation team, perhaps also with an admissions board, and with the local parishes. The admissions process requires sacramental records, an autobiography, a review of psychological and medical assessments (with due regard for CIC, c. 220; CCEO, c. 23), interviews, transcripts, criminal background checks, and immigration documentation as well as letters of reference.<span class="footnumber">104</span><span class="footnote">See CIC, c. 241 §2; CCEO, c. 342 §2; <i>Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People</i>, art. 13.</span> Diocesan bishops, major superiors, and rectors must have moral conviction about the psychological and physical health of those they admit into priestly formation. In particular, they must be assured that applicants have a requisite level of affective maturity and the capacity to live celibate chastity. They will determine the means necessary to arrive at such certitude, including, for example, their own interviews with applicants, the reliable testimony of those who have known the applicant, and psychological and physical assessments made by expert consultants.</p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="57">§57 </span>Once an applicant is admitted to the propaedeutic stage, the application process contributes to the seminarian’s personal plan for priestly formation. Specifically, the observations and conclusions that emerge from the admissions process serve as a significant resource for the seminarian’s human, spiritual, intellectual, and pastoral formation. The sharing of this information presumes a due respect for the rights of the seminarian and a strict maintenance of confidentiality. A written consent, signed by the seminarian, is required before any confidential information can be shared.</p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="58">§58 </span>Without denying the importance of evaluating minimal thresholds in all areas of an applicant’s development, high standards and strict vigilance are especially necessary in evaluating human thresholds pertaining to sexuality. “Sexuality affects all aspects of the human person in the unity of his body and soul. It especially concerns affectivity, the capacity to love and to procreate, and in a more general way the aptitude for forming bonds of communion with others.”<span class="footnumber">105</span><span class="footnote"><i>Catechism of the Catholic Church</i>, no. 2332.</span> For the seminary applicant, thresholds pertaining to sexuality serve as the foundation for living a lifelong commitment to healthy, celibate chastity.</p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="59">§59 </span>In forming a prudent judgment about the suitability of an applicant for priestly formation, the principle of gradualism should be used. According to the principle of gradualism, progressively higher levels of expectations should be sought as an individual advances to progressively higher levels of preparation, moving from the propaedeutic stage into the discipleship, configuration, and vocational synthesis stages. In short, the further a seminarian advances in the program toward priestly ordination, the greater should be his development of the requisite qualities. The principle of gradualism recognizes that it would be unrealistic to expect an applicant for seminary formation who is beginning the propaedeutic stage to be fully mature in all areas. The time devoted to the propaedeutic stage is especially important in determining if the seminarian has the qualities necessary for further priestly formation in the stages that follow.</p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="60">§60 </span>The principle of gradualism, however, does not deny that a minimal level of development is necessary for admission to a priestly formation program. The minimal qualities necessary for admission are properly understood as thresholds or foundations. All applicants need to have reached certain thresholds of human, spiritual, intellectual, and pastoral development, which will serve as foundations for further development.</p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="61">§61 </span>Applicants for admission should have attained, at least in some measure appropriate to their chronological age, qualities in those areas represented by the integrated dimensions of formation identified in <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>: human, spiritual, intellectual, and pastoral. In trying to determine what is sufficient growth or development in these areas, admission criteria must be clear and specific. For example:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Thresholds in the human dimension considered sufficient for admission into the propaedeutic stage mean not only an absence of serious pathology but also a proven capacity to function competently in ordinary human situations without a need for extensive therapeutic or remedial work to be fully functioning, a psychosexual maturity commensurate with chronological age, a genuine empathy that enables the applicant to connect well and personally with others, a demonstrated ability to initiate and sustain friendships, a capacity for growth or conversion, and a deep desire to be a man for others in the likeness of Christ.</li>
      <li>Sufficient spiritual thresholds include a person who prays regularly, is active in parish life, participates in the Sunday Eucharist and regularly in the Sacrament of Penance, and is drawn to explore and deepen his spiritual life and share it with others. In the case of an applicant for an institute of consecrated life or society of apostolic life, the man should demonstrate a firm acceptance and adherence to the Rule of Life of the institute or the constitution of the society, especially regarding its practices of liturgical, sacramental, and personal prayer.</li>
      <li>Sufficient intellectual thresholds include proven capacities for critical thinking, an ability to understand both abstract and practical questions, and the capacity to understand other persons and to communicate effectively with them in both oral and written form.</li>
      <li>Sufficient pastoral thresholds include having a fundamental sense of the Church’s mission and a generous willingness and enthusiasm to promote it, having a sensitivity to the needs of others and a desire to respond to them, and having a willingness to initiate action for the good of individuals and communities.</li>
      <li>Finally, applicants should also have the right intention when they present themselves for admission to a priestly formation program. Their intention to pursue preparation for priestly ordination and ministry should correspond to the Church’s understanding. Given the probationary nature of the propaedeutic stage to provide a solid basis for the spiritual life and to nurture a greater self-awareness for personal growth—and given that men begin this stage from various backgrounds, levels of maturity, and life experiences—it will take time during the propaedeutic stage for these qualities to be observed and strengthened.</li>

These policies include behavioral criteria that place on applicants the burden of qualification for admission to a priestly formation program. In cases of doubt, caution should be taken and the benefit of the doubt given to the Church.

      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="65">§65 </span>All applicants should give witness to their conviction that God has brought them to the formation program to discern whether they are really called to the priesthood; and they should commit themselves wholeheartedly to carrying out that discernment, demonstrate dedication to the formation program, and exhibit appropriate respect to their formators. The applicant should be alert both to signs that seem to confirm that call and to counterindications. As the applicant and then seminarian journeys through the stages of formation, there should be a growing sense of confirmation of that call.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="66">§66 </span>Applicants must undergo a thorough screening process appropriate to the admission processes. Personal interviews with the applicants, evaluations from their pastors and teachers, records and evaluations from a previous seminary or institute of consecrated life or society of apostolic life if applicable,<span class="footnumber">108</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 198.</span> academic records, standardized test scores, psychological evaluations, and criminal background checks<span class="footnumber">109</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People</i>, art. 13.</span> are all components of an effective admission program, and they are weighed together with an assessment of the applicant’s motivation. Those who do not fulfill minimal thresholds for admission must not be admitted.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="67">§67 </span>It is the responsibility of the vocation director of the ecclesiastical entity to provide the admissions board with a summary of the results of the screening process. It is his responsibility to provide to the rector of the seminary, in a timely and complete fashion, the results of the screening process used by the ecclesiastical entity. Such provision is to be made only with the applicant’s previous written consent. In the event that further consultation is needed in a particular case, additional release forms must be obtained.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="68">§68 </span>Applicants from diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds should be given every encouragement. An effort must be made by vocation directors and seminaries to honor every vocational stirring. Propaedeutic programs and seminaries are responsible for ensuring the possession of adequate resources to serve the formative needs of such applicants. Formation requirements should not be lessened, but necessary adaptations may be made to enable admission into the regular course of study. Applicants must have an adequate command of the English language to begin intellectual formation in a seminary in which English is the language of instruction. English-language studies may be undertaken in the seminary before admission into the full, regular courses of seminary study. It is also important that applicants from other countries receive special help in gaining the necessary understanding of the religious and cultural context for priestly ministry and life in the United States.<span class="footnumber">110</span><span class="footnote">For more information on assessment, acceptance, reception, and orientation of international candidates, see <i>Guidelines for Receiving Pastoral Ministers in the United States</i>, especially E1-E5; <i>Guidelines for the Use of Psychology in Seminary Admissions</i>, 6.</span></p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="69">§69 </span>Seminaries and ecclesiastical entities must draw up guidelines for psychologists and admission personnel that describe those human traits and qualities that are consonant with an authentic vocation to the priesthood as well as those counterindications that suggest that the applicant is not suitable for priestly formation. Seminaries as well as ecclesiastical entities must ensure that those who conduct psychological evaluations for them have a sound understanding and acceptance of Christian anthropology and are well versed in and supportive of the Church’s expectations for men in priestly formation, especially expectations concerning celibacy, chastity, obedience, and permanence of commitment, as well as the human traits and qualities that are consonant with an authentic priestly vocation.<span class="footnumber">111</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Guidelines for the Use of Psychology in Seminary Admissions</i>, 5-7.</span></p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="70">§70 </span>A psychological assessment is an integral part of the admission procedure. Psychological assessments must be administered using methods that do not violate the applicant’s right to privacy and confidentiality or do harm to the reputation of the applicant. Further, they “must always be carried out with the previous, explicit, informed and free consent of the candidate.”<span class="footnumber">112</span><span class="footnote"><i>Guidelines for the Use of Psychology in the Admission and Formation of Candidates for the Priesthood</i>, no. 5. See CIC, c. 220; CCEO, c. 23.</span> The applicant has an obligation to be honest during the application process regarding any known difficulties of a psychological nature he has experienced as well as any professional counseling he has received.<span class="footnumber">113</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 193.</span> At the same time, the applicant should understand that the testing results will be shared with the diocesan bishop, the vocation director, the rector, and his agent<span class="footnumber">114</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 195.</span> in a way that permits a thorough review. At times formators may need to work with the seminarian on matters related to the evaluation, and thus they will need some knowledge of the assessment. Due care should be observed in correctly interpreting the results of psychological testing in light of the cultural background of applicants.<span class="footnumber">115</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, nos. 191-196; <i>Guidelines for the Use of Psychology in Seminary Admissions</i>, 3.

      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="71">§71 </span>Admission processes should give sufficient attention to the emotional health of applicants. Special care and scrutiny should be given to those who manifest dysfunction or come from dysfunctional families. It is possible for some individuals to address these issues in the course of a formation program through counseling or other means. Their willingness, however, to confront these or other personal issues should be determined prior to the decision about admission. If long-term therapeutic work is indicated, this is best accomplished before the decision is made concerning admission into a priestly formation program. At times, the gravity of family or personal issues is such that, if the discerner has not yet adequately dealt with these issues, entrance into a priestly formation program should be delayed or denied. Similarly, the gravity of family or personal issues is such that, if a seminarian in the propaedeutic stage has not yet adequately dealt with these issues, entrance into the discipleship stage should be delayed or denied.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="72">§72 </span>Admission procedures should include an open and frank discussion of the life experiences that applicants bring to the formation program. Their level of insight or self-knowledge and their willingness to address important human issues—such as their interpersonal abilities, evidence of sound peer relationships, their manner of dealing with authority, and their psychosexual development—can be important gauges of their readiness to enter a formation program. If an individual has any significant unresolved human issues, the seminary is well advised to delay admission until greater clarity or resolution is evident. Concerning the capacity to live the charism of celibacy, the applicant is to have lived in continence for a sustained period of time before entering the propaedeutic stage of priestly formation, so that he may give a strong indication to the vocation director and formators of his capacity for continence and self-possession. In discerning the minimal length of this sustained period of time, indicators in the applicant himself—such as age, life experiences, and capacity for growth in psychosexual maturity—should be considered by admissions personnel.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="73">§73 </span>Admission procedures should include an evaluation of all internet and social media use, including gaming, by the applicant up to the point of application. It will be necessary for formation personnel to assist the discerner and seminarian with any recommended ongoing support.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="74">§74 </span>Any evidence of criminal or compulsive sexual activity or an inclination toward such activity disqualifies the applicant from admission.<span class="footnumber">117</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 202. See also <i>Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People</i>, art. 13.</span></p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="75">§75 </span>With regard to the admission of men with same-sex experiences and/or inclinations, the guidelines provided by the Holy See must be followed.<span class="footnumber">118</span><span class="footnote">See Instruction Concerning the Criteria for the Discernment of Vocations with Regard to Persons with Homosexual Tendencies in View of Their Admission to the Seminary and to Holy Orders.</span> To this end a distinction must be made between deep-seated and transitory tendencies. Persons who “practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called ‘gay culture’” cannot be admitted to either the seminary or Holy Orders.<span class="footnumber">119</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 199.</span> “Different, however, would be the case in which one were dealing with homosexual tendencies that were only the expression of a transitory problem—for example, that of an adolescence not yet superseded.

      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="76">§76 </span>Concerning the results of psychological testing and other confidential materials, the ecclesiastical entity and seminary must observe all Canon Law and civil law requirements, inform the applicant in writing of his specific rights to privacy and confidentiality, and utilize appropriate release forms.<span class="footnumber">122</span><span class="footnote">See CIC, c. 220; CCEO, c. 23.</span> Throughout the admission process and the priestly formation program, the man’s rights to privacy and a good reputation must be respected, and the careful management of confidential materials is to be observed.<span class="footnumber">123</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 196. Due to the diversity of state laws, each ecclesiastical entity and seminary is to determine the length of time for which “documentation related to the physical and psychological health of seminarians is to be stored,” respecting all applicable civil laws.</span> The wording of any release forms must indicate which persons may have access to the information and with whom they can share it, making it explicit that no other sharing is to be allowed without the man’s explicit written permission. In the event that further consultation is needed in a particular case, additional release forms must be obtained.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="77">§77 </span>In the initial admission process, an evaluation should be made of an applicant’s indebtedness, his ability to handle finances (for example, responsible record keeping and payment of personal taxes), spending patterns, and perhaps a willingness to cover a portion of his formation expenses. Applicants should demonstrate an aptitude for learning principles of good stewardship, avoiding any attitudes of entitlement. They should also show an openness to developing professional approaches to personal and Church-related business matters.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="78">§78 </span>The admission process should be attentive to older, experienced applicants, who often bring a mature spirituality, experience in pastoral life, and other significant life experiences but who might also be less docile to formation. The admission processes must be no less rigorous, thorough, or comprehensive than it might be for other applicants.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="79">§79 </span>If an applicant has never been in a formation program, then he must complete a propaedeutic stage lasting not less than one calendar year and a discipleship stage lasting not less than a two-year calendar period. Discipleship stage programs that form men with prior life and education experience (bachelor’s degree or equivalent) must be designed to address all four dimensions of formation, not simply to meet academic requirements.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="80">§80 </span>If applicants have been in a formation program previously, with due regard for what has already been stated regarding criminal or compulsive sexual activity, ecclesiastical entities and seminaries must consult all previous institutions about the past record of these applicants as prescribed in the <i>Norms Concerning Applications for Priestly Formation from Those Previously Enrolled in a Formation Program</i>.<span class="footnumber">124</span><span class="footnote">See USCCB, <i><a href="ReApplying.html" target="blank">Norms Concerning Reapplication for Priestly Formation</a></i>; CIC, c. 241 §3; CCEO, c. 342 §3. These Norms are to be followed in reviewing an application for enrollment in a program of priestly formation that is submitted by one who has previously been enrolled in such a program or who has belonged to an institute of consecrated life or a society of apostolic life.</span> While remaining confidential, “the reasons [for dismissal] should be given with the greatest possible objectivity, avoiding ambiguity and the use of euphemisms.”<span class="footnumber">125</span><span class="footnote"><i>Scrutinies</i>, no. 8.</span> It is also important to learn the reasons for leaving, if a seminarian left a formation program on his own initiative. Regardless of whether a seminarian was dismissed or left, if the records indicate difficulties, the ecclesiastical entity and seminary should proceed with due caution and prudence before admitting the applicant and should ascertain whether problems have been resolved and sufficient positive growth has taken place. In serious cases involving issues with Church doctrine or behavior, inside or outside a formation program, admittance is unwise.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="81">§81 </span>If an applicant has been dismissed from a program of priestly formation or from an institute of consecrated life or society of apostolic life, no subsequent application will be considered in the two years following such dismissal. If the departure was other than a dismissal, sufficient time should be allotted to evaluate carefully his application and background.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="82">§82 </span>Prior to admission into a formation program, the ecclesiastical entity, usually through the vocation director, is obliged to ensure (and the seminary must verify) that recent certificates of Baptism and Confirmation (or Chrismation with holy Myron) have been obtained and to determine (if applicable) into which Eastern Catholic Church sui iuris the applicant is ascribed.<span class="footnumber">126</span><span class="footnote">See CIC, c. 241 §2; CCEO, c. 342 §2.</span> The diocese must also obtain the following documentation from others: summaries of personal interviews with the applicant, evaluations from his pastor and teachers, academic records, standardized test scores, assessments of the applicant’s motivation conducted by experienced formators, and, if applicable, previous seminary evaluations. The seminary must verify the completion of all documentation before an applicant is admitted.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="83">§83 </span>The admission process by the ecclesiastical entity also must include a thorough physical examination to ensure that applicants possess the good health necessary for seminary training and priestly ministry. This exam should include HIV and drug testing along with screening that verifies biological maleness. </p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="84">§84 </span>A thorough assessment of an applicant’s marital history is a necessary part of the admission process. An applicant for the priesthood in the Latin Church must testify that he is not married, even if only civilly, or that, if he is married, he has received a dispensation from the Apostolic See.<span class="footnumber">127</span><span class="footnote">See CIC, c. 1047 §2, 3°.</span> If an Eastern Catholic discerner is married, a certificate of marriage is required along with the written consent of his wife<span class="footnumber">128</span><span class="footnote">See CCEO, c. 769 §1, 2°.</span> and any necessary consultations required by the Apostolic See.<span class="footnumber">129</span><span class="footnote">See Congregation for the Oriental Churches, Pontificia Praecepta de Clero Uxorato Orientali, June 14, 2014, AAS 106: 496-499.</span> Applicants who have received a declaration of matrimonial nullity should be carefully screened. Although these men may have canonical freedom to pursue the priesthood, it is important to ascertain if and how previous obstacles to a marriage commitment or possible scandal might affect their viability as fit applicants for priestly formation. Care must be taken to review the canonical declaration of nullity and the relevant documentation to ensure that the reasons and circumstances that serve as warrants for the declaration of nullity are fully disclosed to the sponsoring bishop or competent authority, rector, and the seminary admissions committee. If a previously married person has natural obligations toward a previous spouse, and/or primary responsibility for a minor child, this information should be carefully considered. All such cases should be carefully weighed.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="85">§85 </span>Careful screening should also be given to applicants who are recent converts to the Catholic faith or who have lapsed in the practice of their faith and have recently returned. It is advisable that at least two years pass between their entry into the Church and their admission into the propaedeutic stage. A suitable period of time should pass before entrance into a formation program, in cases of Catholics for whom a sudden conversion experience seems to precipitate a priestly vocation. Similarly, those who return to the practice of the faith after an extended period away from the Church should not enter a formation program directly.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="86">§86 </span>The seminary is obligated to determine the freedom of the applicant from the impediments and irregularities for receiving Holy Orders and from conditions that must be addressed prior to the reception of Holy Orders, namely, that sufficient time has passed for a neophyte;<span class="footnumber">130</span><span class="footnote">See CIC, c. 1042, 3°; CCEO, c. 762 §1, 8°.</span> that the applicant does not hold a position forbidden to clerics;<span class="footnumber">131</span><span class="footnote">See CIC, cc. 285-286, 289, 1042, 2°; CCEO, cc. 762 §1, 7°, 382-385.</span> that the applicant does not “labor under some form of amentia or other psychic illness”;<span class="footnumber">132</span><span class="footnote">See CIC, c. 1041, 1°; CCEO, c. 762 §1, 1°; <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, nos. 191-196.</span> that he has not committed the delict of apostasy, heresy, or schism;<span class="footnumber">133</span><span class="footnote">See CIC, c. 1041, 2°; CCEO, c. 762 §1, 2°.</span> and that he has not committed voluntary homicide, positively cooperated in a completed abortion,<span class="footnumber">134</span><span class="footnote">See CIC, c. 1041, 4°; CCEO, c. 762 §1, 4°.</span> gravely and maliciously mutilated himself or another, attempted suicide,<span class="footnumber">135</span><span class="footnote">See CIC, c. 1041, 5°; CCEO, c. 762 §1, 5°.</span> or simulated an act reserved to priests or bishops.<span class="footnumber">136</span><span class="footnote">See CIC, c. 1041, 6°; CCEO, c. 762 §1, 6°.</span> If any of these conditions exist, then prior to admission, appropriate dispensations or remedies must be obtained, including, when necessary, recourse to the tribunal of the Apostolic Penitentiary when the existence of the impediment is not a publicly known fact.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="91">§91 </span>Integral formation is successful when it is supported by a trusting atmosphere of personal and communal accompaniment. “The purpose of personal accompaniment is to carry out vocational discernment and to form the missionary disciple.”<span class="footnumber">138</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 44.</span> So too the role of the community is crucial in accompaniment. “Formation comes about every day through interpersonal relationships, moments of exchange and discussion which result in the development of that ‘fertile soil,’ in which a vocation matures concretely.”<span class="footnumber">139</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 50.</span></p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="92">§92 </span>Relationships characterized by trust are essential for accompaniment to be successful. “The program of formation should explore and outline the concrete ways in which this trust can be encouraged and safeguarded. Above all, those conditions should be sought and fostered, which can, in some way, create a peaceful climate of trust and mutual confidence: fraternity, empathy, understanding, the ability to listen and to share, and especially a coherent witness of life.”<span class="footnumber">140</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 47.</span></p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="93">§93 </span>The relationships in the external forum are those between a seminarian and his bishop or competent authority, including the agents of the bishop or competent authority (rector, vice rector, vocation director, director of seminarians, and other formators, with the exception of the spiritual director). The term “external forum” includes discussions surrounding any observable behavior of the seminarian and the attitudes and motivations related to these behaviors. The Church has a right and responsibility to know the man she is ordaining, and therefore the seminarian has a corresponding responsibility to let himself be known. These discussions generally include, but are not limited to, vocational discernment, growth in maturity in all four dimensions, integration and behaviors regarding interior freedom, and behaviors related to the promises of prayer, obedience, and celibacy.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="94">§94 </span>The primary relationship in the internal forum is that between a seminarian and his spiritual director. The purpose of the “internal forum” is to protect the manifestation of conscience of the seminarian and to provide him the space to share about his interior life with the moral freedom that is necessary for genuine growth and discernment. These discussions generally include, but are not limited to, movements in prayer, vocational discernment, growth in interior freedom, and struggles and growth in preparation for the promises of prayer, obedience, and celibacy.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="95">§95 </span>While the manifestation of conscience and sacramental confession are never part of the external forum, over time the seminarian will grow comfortable discussing appropriate interior matters related to his vocation with formators in the external forum. A solid relationship of trust with his formators in both fora will benefit the seminarian as he receives guidance from all formators. This relationship will allow major decisions to be reached following regular discussions throughout the formation process, so that the seminarian will not be surprised by decisions reached by those responsible for his formation, and vice versa. It must be clear that the material of spiritual direction and confession are not to be shared by spiritual directors with external forum personnel.<span class="footnumber">141</span><span class="footnote">See Congregation for Catholic Education, Report on the Apostolic Visitation of the American Seminaries, December 15, 2008.</span></p>

The growth of interior freedom leads ultimately to a configuration to Christ and thus makes him capable and willing to live the Paschal Mystery of Christ in his own life. The formator accompanies the man in this gradual growth process and assists “the seminarian in becoming aware of his condition, of the talents that he has received, and of his frailties, so that he can become ever more receptive to the action of grace.”<span class="footnumber">153</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 46.</span> This dialogue will involve challenge and encouragement, correction and accountability, as the formator listens to the deeper motives behind the actions of the seminarian and helps him to integrate the various aspects of his life. It will require cultivating in the seminarian attitudes that promote living a life of virtue. It requires truly knowing the seminarian and his particular growth needs. To this end, “it is important that every seminarian be aware of his own life history, and be ready to share it with his formators. This would include especially his experience of childhood and adolescence, the influence that his family and his relatives have exercised upon him, his ability to establish mature and well balanced interpersonal relationships, or his lack thereof, and his ability to handle positively moments of solitude.”<span class="footnumber">154</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 94.</span> Such accompaniment must bring together all the aspects of the human person, allowing him to surrender his whole life to Christ in obedience and interior freedom. “In fact it is only in the crucified and risen Christ that this path of integration finds meaning and completion; all things are united in him (see Eph 1:10).”<span class="footnumber">155</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 29.</span></p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="101">§101 </span>The key element in this formative accompaniment is mutual trust. It is essential that “the seminarian should know himself and let himself be known.”<span class="footnumber">156</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 45.</span> This openness is required for real formation to happen. If a man hides his struggles in formation, growth cannot happen. The seminary community should seek to create the conditions that foster this peaceful climate of trust and mutual confidence through relationships marked by “fraternity, empathy, understanding, the ability to listen and to share, and especially a coherent witness of life.”<span class="footnumber">157</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 47.</span> This climate of mutual confidence will be helped by the formators accompanying the seminarians outside of formal meetings in meals, recreation, and other potentially formative experiences. These times can provide excellent opportunities to know the seminarians and provide the formation that comes from witness of life and ordinary encounters. When the seminarian experiences that the priest formators live true fatherhood seeking his good, and that the life of the seminary is marked by a spirit of true fraternity, this trust will not be difficult to establish.<span class="footnumber">158</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 52.</span></p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="102">§102 </span>To arrive at the necessary depth of formation, conversations between the formator and the seminarian should normally occur about once a month.<span class="footnumber">159</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 46.</span> Just as it is beneficial for seminarians to remain with the same spiritual director for longer periods of time, it is preferable that one formator work with the seminarian in the external forum throughout each particular stage of formation. When possible it is advantageous for a seminarian to have the same formator for even longer than one stage of formation.</p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="103">§103 </span>The Church is clear about the importance of the role of this priest formator and the needed formation for it:</p>
        <blockquote>The formator must exercise discretion when it comes to the lives of seminarians. Each formator should be possessed of human, spiritual, pastoral and professional abilities and resources, so as to provide the right kind of accompaniment that is balanced and respectful of the freedom and the conscience of the other person, and that will help him in his human and spiritual growth. Moreover, those who are marked out to become formators need a specific preparation and generous dedication to this important task. Formators are needed who can ensure their full-time presence and who, above all else, are witnesses of how to love and serve the people of God, giving themselves without reserve for the Church.<span class="footnumber">160</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 49.</span></blockquote>

        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="109">§109 </span>Because spiritual direction in a seminary context differs from spiritual direction more generally experienced in the Church, the seminary must explain to seminarians the purpose and process of spiritual direction in the seminary.

    <button type="button" class="collapsible title2">An Integral Formation</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="114">§114 </span>Formation, as the Church understands it, is not equivalent to a secular sense of schooling or, even less, of job training. It begins for all Christians at Baptism and continues throughout life. God uses the entirety of one’s life experiences continually to invite the believer to draw closer to him. He is always at work in the soul as the master craftsman, shaping and molding us. So too, for those he has chosen to pursue the path of priesthood, whether in a diocesan or a consecrated vocation, his quiet yet constant presence is always at work. “The formation of priests means following a singular ‘journey of discipleship,’ which begins at Baptism, is perfected through the other sacraments of Christian Initiation, comes to be appreciated as the center of one’s life at the beginning of Seminary formation, and continues through the whole of life.”<span class="footnumber">167</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, Introduction, no. 3.</span> While formation is a lifelong journey, the time spent preparing for ordained ministry is a privileged time of growth in self-knowledge and deepening intimacy with Jesus Christ. At the beginning of the seminary journey, “the seminarian is a ‘mystery to himself,’ in which two aspects of his humanity, that need to be integrated, are intertwined and exist side by side. On the one hand he is characterized by talents and gifts that have been molded by grace; on the other he is marked by his limits and frailty. The task of formation is to help the person to integrate these aspects, under the influence of the Holy Spirit, in a journey of faith and of gradual and harmonious maturity, avoiding fragmentation, polarization, excesses, superficiality or partiality.”<span class="footnumber">168</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 28.</span></p>
      <p>Formation to the priesthood is described in the human, spiritual, intellectual, and pastoral dimensions. However, one must always keep in mind that these dimensions are not compartmentalized but are held in concert with one another. In a similar way, discipleship, configuration, and vocational synthesis, while recognized as stages on the journey toward priesthood, are never finished. Following ordination, the priest always remains a disciple of Jesus Christ, who is called throughout his life to cooperate with God’s grace in configuring his life more each day to that of the great High Priest.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="115">§115 </span>Integral formation attempts to bring together, as much as possible, the four dimensions of formation in the seminarian as he matures into an authentic priestly identity. The four dimensions of human, spiritual, intellectual, and pastoral formation are interrelated aspects of a human response to God’s transforming grace. Without attention to integration in all stages of formation, the overall goal of formation, configuration to the heart and life of the Lord Jesus, cannot be achieved. While each seminary must have a structured plan of formation for all seminarians, the integration of the four dimensions must be personalized in each particular man “to achieve a serene and creative interior synthesis between strength and weakness.”<span class="footnumber">169</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 29.</span></p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="116">§116 </span>Through human formation the foundation is laid upon which the other dimensions can be received and lived. Through spiritual formation, the seminarian learns to bring everything from the other dimensions into his relationship with Jesus Christ. Through intellectual formation he comes to a deeper understanding of the truths of faith and the human person, enriching his relationship with God, his understanding of himself, and his service to others. Through pastoral formation he learns how to express the other three in pastoral charity, the overall goal of priestly formation. It is through the integration of all four dimensions that the seminarian comes to the affective maturity and freedom needed for priestly service.</p>
      <blockquote>Each of the dimensions of formation is aimed at “transforming” or “assimilating” the heart in the image of the heart of Christ [cf. <i>Optatam Totius</i>, no. 4; <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 57], who was sent by the Father to fulfill his loving plan. He was moved when faced with human suffering (cf. Mt 9:35-36), he went to seek out the lost sheep (cf. Mt 18:12-14), even to offering his life for them (cf. Jn 10:11). He came not to be served but to serve (cf. Mt 20:24-28). As the Second Vatican Council indicates [see <i>Optatam Totius</i>, nos. 4, 19], the entire process of formation in preparation for priestly ministry, in fact, has as its aim the preparation of seminarians to “enter into the communion with the charity of Christ the Good Shepherd.”<span class="footnumber">170</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 89, quoting <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 57.</span></blockquote>
      <p>The goal is the development not just of a well-rounded person, a prayerful person, or an experienced pastoral practitioner, but rather of one who understands his formation within the context of his call to service in the Church.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="117">§117 </span>In the beginning stages of formation, the seminarian must be presented with specific areas of growth in each dimension so that he is able immediately to see the need for formation within himself, no matter how challenging this may be for him. In the later stages of formation there needs to be a systematic approach to growth in each of the stages of formation with the hopes that the man will naturally see the areas of growth needed in himself and will therefore continue to desire to be formed even after priestly ordination.</p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible title2">Seminary Stages of Formation</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="118">§118 </span>Formation in the seminary begins by focusing in a concentrated way on the seminarian’s relationship with Jesus Christ. The seminarian first became a disciple of Christ at his Baptism; formation in the seminary will enable him to grow as a disciple who is discerning and preparing for ordained ministry. He is gradually formed into a shepherd who is called to make a gift of his life in pastoral charity for the People of God. This gradual development of the future priest has as its goal growth in holiness, so as to become configured to Christ, Head and Shepherd, Servant and Spouse.</p> <button type=" button" class="collapsible title3">Propaedeutic Stage</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="119">§119 </span>The propaedeutic stage seeks to provide seminarians with the basic groundwork they need to engage in priestly formation. Through no fault of their own, the requisite qualities for formation are often missing in new seminarians. A significant imbalance is present between the lifestyle promoted by contemporary society and priestly formation. There are many generous young men open to a priestly call who nevertheless need more intensive preparation before they are ready to enter into the discipleship stage of formation; thus, a propaedeutic stage prior to the discipleship stage is essential. Indeed, even men who have benefited from stronger formation from family and parish life can still profit from a period of consolidation and growth in prayer, trust, and fraternity. Given that men discern a priestly vocation and apply to a formation program for an ecclesiastical entity from a variety of life circumstances, the propaedeutic stage satisfies the “need to dedicate a period of time to preparation of an introductory nature, in view of the priestly formation to follow or, alternatively, of the decision to follow a different path in life.”<span class="footnumber">171</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 59.</span> While the way in which the propaedeutic stage is accomplished in ecclesiastical entities will vary,<span class="footnumber">172</span><span class="footnote">For example, in an institute of consecrated life or society of apostolic life, the propaedeutic stage is accomplished during the postulancy and/or novitiate.</span> nonetheless, the stage is mandatory for all men in initial formation.</p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="120">§120 </span>Formation is a lifelong journey. It is important to lay a solid foundation for this journey in the propaedeutic stage, especially in the human and spiritual dimensions, such that the seminarian can thrive in the discipleship, configuration, and vocational synthesis stages of formation. Thus “the propaedeutic stage is an indispensable phase of formation with its own specific character.”<span class="footnumber">173</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 59.</span> This stage allows the seminarian to lay a foundation for a new way of life by developing a life of prayer, study, fraternity, and appropriate docility to formation.</p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="121">§121 </span>“In the formation that is offered, emphasis should be placed on communion with one’s Bishop, with the presbyterate and with the entire particular Church.”<span class="footnumber">174</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 60.</span> Gaining a greater understanding of the local Church and an awareness of the pastoral situations present in one’s ecclesiastical entity will assist the seminarian in discerning his vocation. The propaedeutic stage should also offer an opportunity to develop “the dynamic of self-giving through experiences in the parish setting and charitable works.”<span class="footnumber">175</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 59.</span></p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="122">§122 </span>Another central goal of the propaedeutic stage is an intense and profound vocational discernment, undertaken within a community.<span class="footnumber">176</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 60.</span> A first discernment was made during the admission process within the diocese by the bishop, pastor, and vocation director. The propaedeutic stage provides for a second discernment of the seminarian who is living a daily community life for at least twelve months. During this time, it should become clear whether he has the qualities and the maturity to integrate the four dimensions of priestly formation going forward. The propaedeutic stage should conclude with the seminarian’s making a firm resolution to dedicate himself to the work of priestly formation or, alternatively, “to follow a different path in life” as a faithful lay Catholic.<span class="footnumber">177</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 59.</span> A decision to proceed to priestly formation must always be confirmed by the Church.</p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="123">§123 </span>Conferences that teach a man how to pray, especially scriptural meditation and the art of lectio divina, are essential to the propaedeutic stage. Time for silence, mental prayer, and spiritual reading will help to lay a solid foundation for future stages of formation and ongoing formation. It is encouraged that men in this stage experience retreats that focus on an ability to discern the promptings of the Holy Spirit, an opportunity to develop a strong relationship with Jesus Christ, and vocational discernment.</p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="124">§124 </span>The propaedeutic stage must always be the first of the four stages of initial formation.<span class="footnumber">178</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 59.</span></p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="125">§125 </span>The propaedeutic stage is “not to be less than one year or more than two”;<span class="footnumber">179</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 59.</span> the minimum one-year duration of the propaedeutic stage is twelve calendar months (not an academic year). A third year is permissible provided that the overall character of the stage is preserved throughout. A three-year propaedeutic stage presumes two years of full-time academic studies of a general nature (without philosophical studies, which are restricted to the discipleship stage), followed by one year focused on human, spiritual, and pastoral formation. If this option is utilized, the first two years are not considered part of the discipleship stage, which must not begin until the propaedeutic stage has been completed.</p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="126">§126 </span>The propaedeutic stage should not be confined to times in which a university or college is in session. There might be fewer vacation periods during the propaedeutic stage. For example, while a break may be envisioned for the Christmas holidays, the celebrations of Holy Week and Easter might take place within the propaedeutic community. Further, since this period lasts a full year, a set period at the beginning and again at the end of the propaedeutic stage, without any courses for academic credit, would assist in ensuring that the goals of this stage are met.</p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="127">§127 </span>“It is fitting that the propaedeutic stage be lived in a community distinct from the Major Seminary and, where at all possible, that it should have its own house.”<span class="footnumber">180</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 60.</span> Normally the propaedeutic stage would take place within the ecclesiastical entity, yet it must have an appropriate number of seminarians to support a healthy community. Community life helps the human dimension bear maximum fruit during the propaedeutic stage. These interactions in the normal course of events will contribute to the seminarian’s personal plan of formation in this and future stages. The propaedeutic stage must always be lived in a specific community with a team of priest formators. An individualized, “personal” propaedeutic stage, such as an apprenticeship to a pastor living in a rectory, is no substitute, since it cannot fulfill the objectives proper to this stage. If the propaedeutic stage takes place within the ecclesiastical entity, the priests delegated by the competent authority are charged with the responsibility of accompanying the seminarians so that they meet the appropriate benchmarks.</p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="128">§128 </span>The propaedeutic stage may take place in a seminary building as long as it remains distinct from the discipleship and configuration stages. The propaedeutic stage must be truly clear and distinct, with its own formators dedicated to this distinct stage.<span class="footnumber">181</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 60.</span> The horarium, scope, and sequence of the propaedeutic stage should be different from the other stages. The propaedeutic stage may have a dress code distinct from that of the discipleship stage, or vice versa. Clerical attire at this stage is premature. Retreats, pilgrimages, and days of reflection may occur more frequently during this stage than in other stages.</p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="129">§129 </span>A seminarian can earn college credit for some of his general studies during the propaedeutic stage. Such coursework should not exceed nine credit hours per semester, so that the stage’s goals and objectives will be accomplished. Classes proper to the propaedeutic stage’s intellectual formation (e.g., biblical literacy, catechesis, prayer and spirituality) must compose the bulk of the intellectual formation of this stage and can be taken for credit.<span class="footnumber">182</span><span class="footnote">See intellectual formation chapter in this document (nos. 260-364).</span> Philosophical studies must not begin until the discipleship stage.</p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="130">§130 </span>Care must be taken that the number of courses does not lay an excessive burden on the man, which could compromise the integrity of the goals and objectives of the propaedeutic stage.</p>

        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="136">§136 </span>The configuration stage demands from the seminarian a great commitment, as it challenges him to acquire a proper priestly spirituality; this includes a greater awareness and personal assumption of priestly identity as he conforms himself to the sentiments and attitudes of the Son, understood as self-offering for the pastoral care of the sheep.

      </div> <button type="button" class="collapsible title3">Vocational Synthesis Stage</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="137">§137 </span>The vocational synthesis stage begins upon the completion of the configuration stage. It is intended primarily as a time not of evaluation, but of integration and transition. Based on the principle of gradualism as found in the <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, the vocational synthesis stage is a gradual realization of the cleric’s responsibility for the care of souls while he resides full-time in a pastoral setting, usually the parish. The goal of the vocational synthesis stage is to help the deacon make this essential transition before assuming the full responsibilities of priestly life and ministry in the context of his particular ecclesiastical entity. Thus, the vocational synthesis stage is distinct from what is commonly referred to as a “pastoral year.”<span class="footnumber">190</span><span class="footnote">See CIC, c. 1032 §2.</span></p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="138">§138 </span>The purpose of the vocational synthesis stage is to allow a deacon to enter into the life of a cleric, incorporating the entirety of the formation he has received from the moment of Baptism until his reception of Holy Orders. Rather than “on-the-job training,” this stage is the living of a vocation as an ordained minister, because the diaconate is a new ontological and existential reality. The vocational synthesis stage is not a period of discernment for the priesthood, which began intensely in the propaedeutic stage and was confirmed during the discipleship and configuration stages. The goal is not so much acquiring new pastoral skills— though these certainly will be gained—but more adjusting well to the life of ministry before advancing to priestly ordination. It is about the deacon’s readiness to assume the duties of full-time priestly ministry. Therefore, it is not a question of suitability for Holy Orders, which was judged during the scrutiny prior to diaconate ordination, but a preparation for the final judgment regarding the conferral of the Order of Priesthood which should be made upon the completion of the vocational synthesis stage.<span class="footnumber">191</span><span class="footnote">See CIC, cc. 1028, 1030.</span></p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="139">§139 </span>The vocational synthesis stage takes place “outside the Seminary building”<span class="footnumber">192</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 75.</span> and “is the time from leaving the Seminary until the subsequent priestly ordination, which obviously is brought about by the conferral of the diaconate.”<span class="footnumber">193</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 74.</span> The vocational synthesis stage takes place within the ecclesiastical entity which the deacon is preparing to serve, since by diaconal ordination the cleric is incardinated into the particular local Church, institute, or society. Thus, another purpose of this stage is the integration of the deacon into the clergy of his diocese, institute, or society, a process that should precede his entrance into the Order of Priests. In this way, the vocation of the deacon is consolidated within a concrete reality, within his own ecclesiastical entity, accompanied by his bishop, superior, presbyterate, religious community, and parish. This provides for a particular formation which most seminaries cannot offer. While every seminary should be capable of forming men to become priests, most seminaries cannot form men to be priests of their own particular ecclesiastical entity.</p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="140">§140 </span>During this stage, the primary formator of the newly ordained cleric is the pastor of the parish where the deacon is assigned, or the bishop or major superior may delegate another priest of the diocese, institute, or society to fulfill this task. The pastor—who should be an exemplary model of the priesthood,<span class="footnumber">194</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, nos. 75, 77.</span> aware of his formative task and of his duty to accompany the transitional deacon—should ensure that there are opportunities for discussion of pastoral situations and opportunities for priestly fraternity that will help the deacon transition well to active ministry and ongoing formation.</p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="141">§141 </span>In this way, the deacon may experience the life of clerical ministry in an environment of openness and dialogue with the pastor, who should accompany him personally and directly regarding his ministerial experiences. This would be accomplished through fraternal and formal exchanges between the deacon and the pastor, such that the preparedness of the deacon for entrance into full priestly life can be evaluated. The trust which has been established and strengthened throughout his years of seminary formation allows him to trust his brothers in ordained ministry, the pastoral team responsible for guiding and evaluating him, and above all his diocesan bishop or the competent authority of his institute of consecrated life or society of apostolic life, whose decisions he accepts with docility.</p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="142">§142 </span>The formation of the deacon in this stage is essentially different from the formation he received in the seminary, in that it involves the accompaniment of the newly ordained cleric to appreciate his new status in the Church as an official representative and a public figure: incorporating, again, all of the human, spiritual, intellectual, and pastoral formation he has received preceding his entrance into the clerical state. In the vocational synthesis stage, the deacon focuses directly on the needs of the people he is called to serve. He applies what he has learned to pastoral situations and recognizes where he needs and desires ongoing growth. The deacon also seeks to become more integrated into the presbyterate and local Church to which he belongs or in which his institute of consecrated life or society of apostolic life is located.</p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="143">§143 </span>Though the vocational synthesis stage takes place outside the seminary, in some dioceses it may be desirable that deacons be accompanied by formators from the seminary. For example, the deacons could gather at the seminary monthly, once every two months, or quarterly for days of prayer, group reflection, and fraternity in order to process the experience of diaconal ministry and engage in sacramental and pastoral practica. Whatever role the seminary may play, a substantial majority of the deacon’s time should be spent engaged in ministry in his diocese, institute, or society. Virtual technology could also be used by the seminary to assist in this accompaniment.</p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="144">§144 </span>The minimum duration of the vocational synthesis stage is six months of residence and diaconal ministry in the diocese, institute, or society.</p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="145">§145 </span>This stage always takes place after the completion of the configuration stage (i.e., the stages are never concurrent). A seminarian petitions for diaconate ordination at the conclusion of the configuration stage or during the vocational synthesis stage.<span class="footnumber">195</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 73. Although CIC, c. 1032 §1, says that “those aspiring to the presbyterate can be promoted to the diaconate only after they have completed the fifth year of the curriculum of philosophical and theological studies,” it does not mandate this practice; CIC specifies the minimum amount of time prior to diaconate ordination. The <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i> specifies that a man may not petition for orders until the completion of the configuration stage.</span></p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="146">§146 </span>Because the mission of the diaconate is oriented toward ministry, rather than academic study, it would be optimal for the seminarian to complete the equivalent of four years of theological studies before petitioning to receive diaconal ordination.<span class="footnumber">196</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 73.</span> Having completed all of his academic requirements, a man can peacefully turn his attention toward diaconal and priestly ministry.</p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="147">§147 </span>With the foregoing in mind, the following are three flexible models regarding the vocational synthesis stage that meet the requirements of the <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i> and are adapted to the realities of priestly formation in the United States.
        <ol type="a">
          <li><i>Model A</i>. Configuration stage lasting four years: diaconate ordination upon successful completion of the configuration stage (including four full years of theological studies), and vocational synthesis stage lasting at least six months in a parish after leaving the seminary).<span class="footnumber">197</span><span class="footnote">See CIC, c. 1031 §1.</span></li>
          <li><i>Model B</i>. Configuration stage lasting three and three-quarters years: diaconate ordination upon successful completion of the configuration stage, and vocational synthesis stage lasting one to three months in the seminary (to complete the four years of theological studies) and then at least six months in a parish after leaving the seminary.</li>
          <li><i>Model C</i>. Configuration stage lasting three and one-half years: diaconate ordination upon successful completion of the configuration stage and the equivalent of four years of theological studies, and vocational synthesis stage lasting at least six months in a parish after leaving the seminary.<span class="footnumber">198</span><span class="footnote">In this last model, it could be possible for a candidate to take what is equivalent to four years of theological studies, eight semesters, in three and one-half years, possibly using summer sessions. It must be kept in mind that an exaggerated emphasis on the intellectual dimension should not restrict growth in the other three dimensions of formation.</span></li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="148">§148 </span>After an initial decision to observe one of the models indicated above for the vocational synthesis stage, time may reveal that a shift to another of the models would be more beneficial for an individual deacon or a particular diocese.</p>

      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="149">§149 </span>Priestly formation occurs in the context of a community, whether a seminary or a house of formation. It is “a continuation in the Church of the apostolic community gathered about Jesus” in which men called to share in a unique way in the priesthood of Christ relive today the formation offered to the Twelve by the Lord.<span class="footnumber">199</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, nos. 60-61.</span> What follows also applies to religious seminarians mutatis mutandis.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="150">§150 </span>The seminary’s life in community mirrors ecclesial communion, which itself is rooted in the Blessed Trinity. This ecclesiology of communion lived out in seminary community is “decisive for understanding the identity of the priest, his essential dignity, and his vocation and mission among the People of God and in the world.”<span class="footnumber">200</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 12.</span> Viewed in this way, the seminary community is the essential formational matrix for those preparing for ordained ministry, which itself “has a radical ‘communitarian form’ and can only be carried out as a ‘collective work.’”<span class="footnumber">201</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 17.</span> The seminary community, then, is committed to fostering the human, spiritual, intellectual, and pastoral formation of future priests.<span class="footnumber">202</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 61.</span></p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="151">§151 </span>The essential work of the seminary takes place in the context of community. Personal growth and character development should progress together harmoniously within a deepening spiritual life. Community life can help overcome difficulties caused by excessive individualism. “Formation comes about every day through interpersonal relationships, moments of exchange and discussion which result in the development of that ‘fertile soil,’ in which a vocation matures concretely.”<span class="footnumber">203</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 50.</span> The seminary is a school of human virtue and of growth in honesty, integrity, intellectual rigor, hard work, and tolerance, where the common good is built with solidarity and discipline—all leavened by humor and healthy enjoyment. The seminary is also a school of spiritual growth in which seminarians are formed into men of prayer, imbued with those virtues that only grace can bring: faith, hope, and charity. “In fact, fraternity is fostered through spiritual growth, which requires a constant effort to overcome various forms of individualism. A fraternal relationship ‘cannot just be left to chance, to fortuitous circumstances,’ but is rather a conscious choice and an ongoing challenge.”<span class="footnumber">204</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 52. See also Pope Francis, “Meeting with Diocesan Priests in the Cathedral of Cassano all’Jonio” (June 21, 2014), L’Osservatore Romano 140 (June 22, 2014): 7.</span> The seminary helps the seminarians develop the relationship and dialogue skills necessary for healthy interpersonal relationships as priests.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="152">§152 </span>Seminary programs of formation have two focal points: (1) the seminary community and its public life as an environment for growth and development that includes many different kinds of relationships, and (2) individual seminarians as they strive to interiorize the values of the spiritual life and integrate the lessons of human, spiritual, intellectual, and pastoral formation. The interplay between individual and community, founded on Christ, lies at the heart of formation.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="153">§153 </span>The experience of the seminary community plays a significant role in the personal and spiritual growth of seminarians. Each stage of formation will shape community in a particular way. Still, at every stage, community is formative in similar ways. The give-and-take among those who share the priesthood as a common vocation sets the right context for formation. Such interaction provides mutual support, promotes tolerance and fraternal correction, and gives an opportunity for the development of leadership and talent among seminarians. It also can motivate seminarians to develop a sense of self-sacrifice and a spirit of collaboration.<span class="footnumber">205</span><span class="footnote">“Seminarians are bound, both individually and as a group, to demonstrate—and not only in their external behavior—that they have internalized an authentically priestly way of life, in humility and in service of their brothers. This is a sign of a mature choice to give themselves to following Christ in a special way.” <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 131.</span> The seminarians and the community of formators form the heart of the seminary community, and this reality needs careful cultivation so that the distinctive aims of seminary formation can be achieved.</p> <button type=" button" class="collapsible title3"><i>Norms for Community</i></button>

        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="156">§156 </span>Each seminary must have a handbook based on the <i>Program of Priestly Formation</i>, approved by the diocesan bishop or major superior, in which the expectations of the formation program of the seminary are clearly stated. These expectations specify the human, spiritual, intellectual, and pastoral components of that formation program and include a Rule of Life as mandated by the <i>Code of Canon Law</i> and the <i>Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches</i>.<span class="footnumber">207</span><span class="footnote">See CIC, c. 243; CCEO, c. 337 §§2-3.</span> The handbook forms the basis of an annual evaluation of the seminarians and is regularly reviewed and updated. In addition to a Rule of Life, the handbook also includes the seminary’s statutes, mission statement, policies and procedures, criteria for admission and ongoing evaluation, process of evaluation, appropriate calendars and schedules, and a description of seminary community roles and house jobs.</p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="157">§157 </span>A Rule of Life—approved by the diocesan bishop or, in the case of an interdiocesan seminary, the bishops involved—is necessary to regulate day-to-day living and to articulate the common values that give a community integrity and purpose. The Rule adapts the <i>Program of Priestly Formation</i> to particular circumstances and especially determines more precisely the points of discipline that pertain to daily life of seminarians and the order of the community. A Rule of Life addresses the essentials of community living while avoiding excessive detail that would stifle individual initiative or talent. It also seeks to balance freedom, responsibility, accountability, activities, and solitude.</p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="158">§158 </span>The rector’s conferences are especially helpful in aiding seminarians to interpret rightly their life in common, their discernment of vocation to the priesthood, and the human and spiritual virtues they strive to appropriate.</p>

In imitating Christ who “became poor although he was rich” (2 Cor 8:9), the seminarian is able to grow in freedom and is able to develop in his heart a special place for the poor and the weak. The seminary environment itself should foster a simple way of life and a spirit of forthright detachment. Seminarians should be made aware that they are accountable for the proper stewardship of material goods and personal health. The Rule of Life must encourage appropriate respect for those in authority and a mature sense of obedience.</p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="161">§161 </span>The seminary should create a climate for mutual respect, communication, and collaboration as a contribution to the overall development of the seminarians as they interact with many other individuals and communities as well. Men and women mingle with seminarians in a variety of settings: personal, academic, pastoral, and ecumenical. The interaction of seminarians with seminary administrative staff and service personnel in the seminary community often reveals attitudes toward others in general. Seminarians’ ongoing contact with their own family and parish or ecclesial movement should continue to form a significant dimension of their life. “The community forms the seedbed of a priestly vocation, since the seminarian emerges from it, in order to be sent back to serve it after ordination. The seminarian to begin with, and later the priest, must have a living bond with the community.”<span class="footnumber">209</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 90. The bonds between formators and seminarians and among the seminarians themselves are also important and “must be marked by a sense of fatherhood and fraternity.” <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 52.</span> Seminarians should participate in parish activities and volunteer for service on a regular basis.</p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="162">§162 </span>The seminary community and individual seminarians should appreciate the presence of a multicultural, multiethnic, and international community within the seminary.

    <div class="content">
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="163">§163 </span>The continuing evaluation of seminarians is linked to their formation as well as to the Church’s responsibility to discern vocations to priesthood as a gift from God. Since formation assumes that a seminarian will be growing both in God’s grace and in his free, human response to that grace, it is important that there be a process to note the benchmarks of that growth. In this way, the Church provides seminarians with encouragement to continue their formation and also with wisdom to identify ways in which that formation may take deeper root. The Church’s responsibility to discern the authenticity of vocations also implies some process whereby the Church, usually working through the seminary, scrutinizes the seminarian’s aptness and readiness to assume the responsibilities of ordained ministry. This ongoing evaluation of seminarians, then, affirms, strengthens, and fosters growth in formation while continuing the process of discernment.</p> <button type=" button" class="collapsible title3"><i>Norms for the Continuing Evaluation of Seminarians</i></button>

It should also involve the input of the seminarians themselves, their various supervisors, and their peers.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="181">§181 </span>The foundation and center of all human formation is the Word made flesh. In his fully developed humanity, he was truly free and with complete freedom gave himself totally for the salvation of the world.<span class="footnumber">226</span><span class="footnote">See Jn 10:17-18; Mk 10:45.</span> <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i> expresses the Christological foundation of human formation: “The Letter to the Hebrews clearly affirms the ‘human character’ of God’s minister”: “he comes from the human community and is at its service, imitating Jesus Christ ‘who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin’ (Heb 4:15).”<span class="footnumber">227</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 5.</span></p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="182">§182 </span>The basic principle of human formation is found in <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>: the human personality of the priest is to be a bridge and not an obstacle for others in their meeting with Jesus Christ, the Redeemer of the human race. As the humanity of the Word made flesh was the instrumentum salutis, so the humanity of the priest is instrumental in mediating the redemptive gifts of Christ to people today.<span class="footnumber">228</span><span class="footnote">From this foundation would stem those particular human qualities identified by St. John Paul II in <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 43: “These qualities are needed for them to be balanced people, strong and free, capable of bearing the weight of pastoral responsibilities. They need to be educated to love the truth, to be loyal, to respect every person, to have a sense of justice, to be true to their word, to be genuinely compassionate, to be men of integrity and, especially, to be balanced in judgment and behavior.”</span> The disciple of Jesus Christ is a person who is free to be who he is in God’s design: someone who does not—in contrast to the popular culture—conceive or pursue freedom as the expansion of options or as individual autonomy detached from others, but who rather overcomes every form of self-promotion or emotional dependency.<span class="footnumber">229</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Veritatis Splendor</i>, no. 34.</span> So that the seminarian might act with interior freedom rather than simply demonstrating a “veneer of virtuous habits,” human formation seeks to help the seminarian grow in interior maturity.<span class="footnumber">230</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 41.</span> As <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i> emphasizes, human formation is the “necessary foundation” of priestly formation.<span class="footnumber">231</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 43.</span></p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="183">§183 </span>The human formation of men for the priesthood aims to prepare them to be apt instruments of Christ’s grace. It does so by fostering the growth of a man who can be described in these ways:
    <ol type="a">
      <li><i>A person of solid moral character with a finely developed moral conscience, a man open to and capable of conversion</i>: A man who demonstrates the human virtues of prudence, justice, fortitude, temperance, humility, chastity, constancy, sincerity, patience, good manners, truthfulness, and keeping his word, and who also manifests growth in the practice of these virtues.</li>
      <li><i>A prudent and discerning man</i>: Someone who demonstrates a “capacity for critical observation” so that he “can discern true and false values, since this is an essential requirement for establishing a constructive dialogue with the world of today.”<span class="footnumber">232</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ecclesia in America</i>, no. 40.</span></li>
      <li><i>A man of communion</i>: A person who has real and deep relational capacities, someone who can enter into genuine dialogue and friendship, a person of true empathy who can understand and know other persons, a person open to others and available to them with a generosity of spirit. The man of communion is capable of making a gift of himself and of receiving the gift of others. This ability, in fact, requires the full possession of himself. This life should be one of inner joy and inner peace—signs of self- possession and generosity.</li>
      <li><i>A good communicator</i>: Someone who listens well, is articulate, and has the skills of effective communication and public speaking.</li>
      <li><i>A person of affective maturity</i>: Someone whose life of feelings is in balance and integrated into thought and values; in other words, a man of feelings who is not driven by them but who freely lives his life enriched by them. This might be especially evident in his ability to live well with authority, in his ability to take direction from another, and in his ability to exercise authority well among his peers, as well as an ability to deal productively with conflict and stress.</li>
      <li><i>A man who demonstrates growth in respect for, care of, and vigilance over his body</i>: A person who pays appropriate attention to his physical well-being (including weight, exercise, consumption of food and drink, and hygiene), so that he has the energy and strength to accomplish the tasks entrusted to him and the self-knowledge to face temptation and resist it effectively.</li>
      <li><i>A man who relates well with others, free of prejudice, and who is willing to work with people of diverse cultural backgrounds</i>: A man capable of wholesome relations with women and men<span class="footnumber">233</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 95.</span> as relatives, friends, colleagues, staff members, and teachers and as people encountered in areas of apostolic work.</li>
      <li><i>A good steward of material possessions</i>: Someone who is able to live a simple style of life and to “refrain from all things that have a semblance of vanity”;<span class="footnumber">234</span><span class="footnote">CIC, c. 282 §1; CCEO, c. 385 §1.</span> someone who has the right attitude toward the goods of this world, since his portion and inheritance is the Lord;<span class="footnumber">235</span><span class="footnote">See Ps 16:5-6.</span> someone who is generous in making charitable contributions and sustaining the poor.<span class="footnumber">236</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Presbyterorum Ordinis</i>, no. 17; CIC, c. 282 §2; CCEO, c. 385 §1.</span></li>
      <li><i>A man who can take on the role of a public person</i>: Someone both secure in himself and convinced of his responsibility, who is able to live not just as a private citizen but as a public person in service of the Gospel and representing the Church.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="184">§184 </span>Education in the awareness and mature use of social media is a vital component of human formation in seminaries. Prudence and discernment are more important in our current environment than they perhaps were in the past because information technology in our era advances exponentially faster than at any other time in human history. On the one hand, information technology can be used as a powerful tool for pastoral ministry, most notably evangelization. On the other hand, it habituates us to substituting the virtual for the real, desensitizing us to reality. In addition, careless and undiscerning use of information technology is morally dangerous and may lead to addictive behavior. Seminarians must be taught “how to use these technologies in a competent and appropriate way, shaped by sound theological insights and reflecting a strong priestly spirituality grounded in constant dialogue with the Lord.”<span class="footnumber">237</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 97; see <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, nos. 97-100.</span> Seminarians must use social media and technology in accordance with local diocesan/ eparchial policies, especially in regard to communication with minors.</p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="185">§185 </span>Human formation comes together in a particular way in the domain of human sexuality, and this is especially true for those who are preparing for a life of celibacy. The various dimensions of being a human person—the physical, the psychological, and the spiritual—converge in affective maturity, which includes human sexuality. Education is necessary for understanding sexuality and living chastely. Those preparing to live out a celibate commitment face particular challenges, especially in today’s cultural context of permissiveness and easy access to pornography.</p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="186">§186 </span>Education for chastity, a virtue incumbent on all Christians and in a unique way embraced in celibacy, presents it as a “virtue that develops a person’s authentic maturity and makes him or her capable of respecting and fostering the ‘nuptial meaning’ of the body.”<span class="footnumber">238</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 44.</span> For all Christians, whatever their state of life, chastity cultivates the capacity for authentic self-gift in generative and faithful love. The celibate person renounces the realization of this capacity in marriage but embraces it in a universalizing love extended to all people. At the same time, the celibate commitment requires the development of particular habits and skills of living and relating in order to live the commitment with integrity. “Since the charism of celibacy, even when it is genuine and has proved itself, leaves one’s affections and instinctive impulses intact, candidates to the priesthood need an affective maturity which is prudent, able to renounce anything that is a threat to it, vigilant over both body and spirit, and capable of esteem and respect in interpersonal relationships between men and women.”<span class="footnumber">239</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 44.</span></p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="187">§187 </span>Seminary formation in sexuality and celibacy communicates to men in priestly formation and enables them to appropriate the following:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Their call to priestly celibacy as a share in the chastity of Christ, Head and Shepherd, Servant and Spouse<span class="footnumber">240</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Sacramentum Caritatis</i>, no. 24.</span></li>
      <li>The physiological and psychological understanding of human sexuality</li>

      <li>The requisite skills for living chastely: ascetical practice, prudent self-mastery, and paths of self-knowledge, such as a regular personal inventory and the examination of conscience</li>
      <li>The meaning of celibate chastity, especially the theological rationale that makes clear how it pertains to the logic of the ordained priesthood</li>
      <li>The means to live celibate chastity well, including genuine friendships; priestly fraternity; a mentoring relationship; spiritual direction; priestly asceticism, which honestly reckons with the sacrifices that celibacy entails; and especially the Sacrament of Penance</li>

      <li>The spiritual path that transforms the experience of loneliness into a holy solitude based on a “strong, lively and personal love for Jesus Christ”<span class="footnumber">244</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 44.</span></li>
      <li>An attitude that discerns the culture in the light of the Gospel,<span class="footnumber">245</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Gaudium et Spes</i>, no. 4.</span> seeing the positive and negative potentials of mass communications, various forms of entertainment, and technology, such as the internet<span class="footnumber">246</span><span class="footnote">See CIC, c. 666.</span></li>
      <li>The capacity—for seminarians who are married or are discerning marriage in those jurisdictions that permit the priestly ordination of married men—to “shine forth with the splendor of chastity” and “to offer an outstanding example to other Christian faithful” in conducting family life and in educating children<span class="footnumber">247</span><span class="footnote">CCEO, cc. 374 and 375.</span></li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="188">§188 </span>In general, human formation happens in a threefold process of self-knowledge, self-possession, and self-gift—and all of this in faith.<span class="footnumber">248</span><span class="footnote">See USCCB Committee on Priestly Formation, Spiritual Formation in the Catholic Seminary (1982).</span> As this process unfolds, the human person becomes more perfectly conformed to the perfect humanity of Jesus Christ, the Word made flesh.<span class="footnumber">249</span><span class="footnote">See Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education, A Guide to Formation in Priestly Celibacy (1974), 19.</span> The resources for fostering this process of human formation in a seminary context are many. They include the following:
    <ol type="a">
      <li><i>Instruction</i>: The rector and other members of the seminary community offer the seminarians instruction in human formation through conferences, courses, and other educational means.</li>
      <li><i>Personal reflection</i>: Seminarians are trained to live life reflectively and to examine, with regularity, their behavior, their motivations, their inclinations, and in general their appropriation of life experience, especially suffering.</li>
      <li><i>Community life and feedback</i>: “A seminarian who freely chooses to enter a seminary must also freely accept and respect its terms.”<span class="footnumber">250</span><span class="footnote">Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education, A Guide to Formation in Priestly Celibacy (1974), 74.</span> The general demands and the rewards of life in community expand self-knowledge and self-control and cultivate generosity of spirit. The community’s attachment to Sacred Scripture and the sacramental life provides a reflective mirror that helps individuals know themselves and summons them to a fuller, more human, more spiritual life. A community’s Rule of Life fosters discipline, self-mastery, and faithful perseverance in commitments.</li>
      <li><i>Application to the tasks of seminary life</i>: Human formation develops through interaction with others in the course of the seminary program. This growth happens, for example, when seminarians learn to accept the authority of superiors, develop the habit of “using their freedom with discretion,” learn to act on their own initiative and to do so energetically, and learn to work “harmoniously with their confreres and with the laity.”<span class="footnumber">251</span><span class="footnote"><i>Optatam Totius</i>, no. 11.</span></li>
      <li><i>Psychological counseling</i>: On occasion, consultation with a psychologist or other licensed mental health professional can be a useful instrument of human formation. Some patterns of behavior, for example, which became set in the seminarian’s early family history, may impede his relational abilities. Understanding one’s psychological history and developing strategies to address elements of negative impact can be very helpful in human formation. This kind of counseling or consultation is distinguished from extensive psychotherapy, which may be needed to address deeply entrenched personal issues that impede full functioning of the person. The seminarian already completed psychological testing as part of the application process. At that time, if extensive and in-depth therapy was necessary, it took place outside of the seminary context prior to the decision concerning admission. It can also be the case that the necessity for such extensive therapy emerges after admission. In the latter case the seminarian is to withdraw from the program and pursue the therapy before being considered for readmission to the seminary and resuming his advancement to Holy Orders.<br>Those who provide these psychological services may not be voting members of the formation team in discerning the admission, continuance, or ordination of a man.<span class="footnumber">252</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 192.</span> Normally, any in-depth assessment regarding the admission or continuance of a man in formation should be made by an outside mental health professional to avoid dual relationships. If the psychologist or other representative of the psychological sciences is a member of the seminary community, their roles are confined to training, teaching, and consulting for therapeutic issues that do not involve serious psychopathology. There should be a very clear agreement of understanding that limits the role and boundaries of such persons in seminary formation, under the purview of the rector. A psychologist might be offered for a seminarian who is asked to explore some issue in formation. Voluntary appointments initiated by seminarians with a psychologist must include a clear discussion of the limits of confidentiality and the need to integrate—implicitly or explicitly—the work of counseling with the priest formator and/or spiritual director.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="189">§189 </span>It is advisable for each seminary to develop “benchmarks of human formation” and to identify them clearly for the seminary community and seminarians.<span class="footnumber">253</span><span class="footnote">The benchmarks for the initial stages of formation are presented for each dimension in this document and may be useful for seminaries in developing this list.</span></p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="190">§190 </span>It is both possible and necessary to integrate human formation with the other three dimensions of formation—the spiritual, the intellectual, and the pastoral. Human formation is integrated with spiritual formation by the Incarnate Word and by the fact that grace builds on nature and perfects nature. Human formation is integrated with intellectual formation by the cultivation of the human functions of perception, analysis, and judgment. It also contributes to intellectual formation by enabling seminarians to pursue theology as a response to the questions of the human condition. Human formation is integrated with pastoral formation, which enables a priest to connect with and care for others with his human personality. Conversely, pastoral formation sharpens his human skills and empathic capacities.</p>

      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="191">§191 </span>Self-knowledge and awareness are key themes in the area of human formation during the propaedeutic stage. Before he begins the discipleship stage, it is important that the seminarian, with the help of formators, be able to reflect upon his personal history (e.g., family of origin, use of technology, personal habits) and his needed areas of growth. Other aspects of the human dimension necessary for beginning the discipleship stage include relational skills (e.g., capacity for healthy and deep friendships, basic social skills and good manners, flexibility, adaptability, a basic capacity for empathy); self-discipline (e.g., capacity for hard work, awareness of the appropriate use of time, basic self-control); a trusting relationship with formators (e.g., openness to correction, awareness of the importance of transparency in formation, growing sense of accountability); and healthy habits of self-care (e.g., beginning an exercise regimen, good personal hygiene, beginning to address any health concerns or unhealthy habits).</p>

It is a period marked by the understanding of and growth in the human virtues, informed and perfected by charity. “This process of formation is intended to educate the person in the truth of his being, in freedom and in self-control. It is meant to overcome all kinds of individualism, and to foster the sincere gift of self, opening him to generous dedication to others.”<span class="footnumber">255</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 63.</span></p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="193">§193 </span>During the discipleship stage, the seminarian continues to learn how to integrate his own self-awareness into a desire to grow in affective maturity as he relates to others in the seminary community. Self-awareness can lead to self-acceptance, self-possession, and eventually to self-gift, as seen in his relational skills.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="194">§194 </span>In addition to demonstrating appropriate boundaries, by the end of this stage he will have the ability to self-reflect on and communicate appropriately emotions surrounding conflict and stress; he exhibits deepening friendships with other seminarians and manifests growth in the virtues of prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance. He demonstrates growth in the admirable human qualities of humility, chastity, constancy, sincerity, patience, good manners, truthfulness, keeping his word, gratitude, affability, liberality, meekness, magnanimity, and perseverance. He exhibits racial sensitivity in his words and actions.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="195">§195 </span>Regarding self-discipline, he develops the tools to manage stress and maintain balance in his life, as well as the ability to use freedom with prudence and discretion.

      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="196">§196 </span>The Church needs and deserves healthy priests. By the completion of the discipleship stage, the seminarian demonstrates discipline with his personal and communal horarium (e.g., having a regular bedtime and being on time to events) and is developing an exercise regimen or participating in some form of communal exercise. He has demonstrated growth in addressing any health concerns, such as unhealthy weight or unhealthy habits.<span class="footnumber">256</span><span class="footnote">Some examples of unhealthy habits are the poor use of time; excessive engagement with social media, gaming, television, or other forms of entertainment; and lack of discipline regarding monetary spending habits.</span> By the end of the discipleship stage, the seminarian is able to regulate his personal use of social media, gaming, and the internet, and he understands and practices healthy alternatives to the overuse of media.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="197">§197 </span>By the end of the discipleship stage, the seminarian will determine with firm resolve whether God is calling him to present himself for the priesthood. His transition to the configuration stage is marked by a level of self-knowledge that permits ongoing growth, especially in his relationships with others. God’s grace will then build upon a human nature that is more mature.</p>

He demonstrates that he deals appropriately with conflict and stress. The completion of the configuration stage is marked by continued growth in interiority and communion; in other words, he demonstrates interior freedom, self-possession, self-motivation, direction, and the capacity for self-donation. The seminarian has internalized seminary expectations and is an example for younger seminarians. He demonstrates this, for example, in his willingness to volunteer for additional responsibilities in the seminary and in his avoidance of gossip and cynicism. The seminarian’s life in the community should reveal his ability for selfless leadership and the relational qualities of solidarity, compassion, empathy, and attentive listening. Continued growth in self-discipline means that he can plan and follow through on assignments, academic and pastoral; that he sets appropriate priorities in his schedule and resolves scheduling conflicts; and that he possesses a strong work ethic.</p>

He exhibits continued growth in addressing any health concerns, and he demonstrates balanced habits of exercise and rest. He has also developed a workable strategy for handling psychological issues in his life. As part of his overall health and well-being, he has well-established habits regarding the proper use of technology (meaning that he limits the entertainment uses of technology and demonstrates appropriate accountability with peers and formators regarding his use of technology). Also, through evaluations, apostolic work, and community living, the seminarian demonstrates an awareness of and capacity to manage appropriate boundaries.<span class="footnumber">257</span><span class="footnote">In formulating criteria for evaluating candidates, seminaries will find the 1997 <i>Scrutinies</i> from the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments an invaluable and authoritative resource.</span></p>

        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="203">§203 </span>This program must have a clear focus on the ordained priesthood as a vocation that brings the seminarians to full human and spiritual potential through love of God and service of others.

        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="207">§207 </span>The seminarian’s human formation is very much affected by the character formation he has received in his family, cultural background, and society. Just as the seminary recognizes that the positive qualities of a seminarian’s prior formation can both indicate a vocation and provide a solid foundation for further growth, it should also address possible deficiencies in his earlier formation and find means to address them.</p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="208">§208 </span>Human formation programs in the seminary should begin with the assumption that the seminarians have the potential to move from self-preoccupation to an openness to transcendent values and a concern for the welfare of others.

      <div class="content">
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="209">§209 </span>Preparation for celibacy is one of the primary aims of the human formation program of any seminary. The seminary must have a coordinated and multifaceted program of instruction, prayerful discernment, dialogue, and encouragement that will aid seminarians to understand the nature and purpose of celibate chastity and to embrace it wholeheartedly in their lives. Sexuality finds its authentic meaning in relation to mature love. Seminarians should understand and manifest a mature love as preparation for a celibate life. The insights of modern psychology can be a considerable aid. The goal of psychosexual, social, and spiritual development should be to form seminarians into chaste, celibate men who are loving pastors of the people they serve.<span class="footnumber">263</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 44.</span></p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="210">§210 </span>The rector should hold periodic conferences on this topic, at least on a yearly basis, in which basic attitudinal and behavioral expectations about the practice of celibacy for priests and seminarians are detailed. He should clearly delineate the kinds of attitudes and behaviors that are acceptable and praiseworthy and the kinds that are not, including an awareness of appropriate boundaries. The rector should address the responsibilities of individual seminarians, both now and later, for themselves and for the common reputation of the community and the priesthood. Clear, concrete terms must be used about the actual meaning of the celibate commitment in the seminary community and later in priestly ministry, if presentations about the value of celibacy are to be persuasive or taken seriously.</p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="211">§211 </span>Human formation for celibacy should aim toward an affective maturity, which is the ability to live a true and responsible love. Signs of affective maturity in the seminarian are prudence, vigilance over body and spirit, compassion and care for others, an ability to express and acknowledge emotions, and a capacity to esteem and respect interpersonal relationships between men and women. Therefore, true friendship is an education in affective maturity.</p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="212">§212 </span>To live fully an effective life of celibate chastity, in imitation of Christ’s sacrificial love, requires knowledge of one’s own sexuality and rightly ordered sexual desires.<span class="footnumber">264</span><span class="footnote">A rightly ordered sexual desire is ordered toward a monogamous, exclusive marriage between a man and woman for the procreation of children.</span> Certain habits or skills are necessary instruments on the path to healthy celibate chastity, and these are to be encouraged in seminary programs. Among these habits and skills are appropriate self-disclosure, a cultivated capacity for self-reflection, an ability to enter into peaceful solitude, ascetical practices that foster vigilance and self-mastery over one’s impulses and drives, and a habit of modesty. An especially important practice is holding all persons in the mystery of God, whether they are encountered in the course of formal ministry or ordinary life. This practice means viewing all persons in God, interceding for them before God, and claiming responsibility to direct them to God.</p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="213">§213 </span>A seminary human formation program should inculcate additional skills for celibate living as care for others, a deepening of the capacity to give and receive love, an ability to practice appropriate self-disclosure, an ability to develop and maintain healthy and inclusive peer friendships, and an ability to set appropriate boundaries by choosing not to act on romantic feelings and by developing self-discipline in the face of temptation. A seminarian must be prepared to accept wholeheartedly the Church’s teaching on sexuality in its entirety, be determined to master all sexual temptations, be prepared to meet the challenge of living chastely in all friendships, and finally be resolved to fashion his sexual desires and passions in such a way that he is able to live a healthy, celibate lifestyle that expresses self-gift in faithful and life-giving love: being attentive to others, helping them reach their potential, not giving up, and investing all one’s energies in the service of the Kingdom of God. Given the pervasive reality of pornography in today’s culture, each program is to address this problem, as well as the appropriate use of electronic media, with pertinent policies and training in virtue.<span class="footnumber">265</span><span class="footnote">ee USCCB, Create in Me a Clean Heart: A Pastoral Response to Pornography (Washington, DC: USCCB, 2015).</span></p>

        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="217">§217 </span>The formation program should articulate the distinctive qualities of simplicity of life appropriate for one preparing for priestly leadership. Simplicity of life is particularly important in our own age when human needs and desires are so consciously manipulated and exploited. A consumer society often reduces people to things, which are used and then discarded, plunging society more deeply into a world of objects, which ironically seem to possess us. In a consumer society, a right attitude toward the world and earthly goods is easily lost. That is why a seminarian has to be helped to cultivate personal self-discipline and asceticism. It is an important pastoral obligation of all priests who accompany people through the journey of life to acquire a sound and balanced perspective about earthly goods and possessions so that they can impart right attitudes to others.<span class="footnumber">268</span><span class="footnote">“Already being used to sacrificing willingly and generously what is not needed, they . . .

The exercise of authority and the response of obedience are works of grace, goodwill, and human effort that play a part in the life of every priest. Seminarians should appreciate and integrate the necessary role that authority and organization play in achieving and maintaining any community’s goals and purposes, as well as recognize the theological and spiritual dimension of reverence and obedience in the Catholic Church.

        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="222">§222 </span>The rector of the seminary has the responsibility to delineate attitudinal and behavioral expectations regarding all aspects of human formation, especially those appropriate to a life of celibacy, a life of simplicity, and a life of obedience.</p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="223">§223 </span>The community of formators should provide the guidance and direction necessary to help seminarians meet the challenge of emotional and psychosexual growth. In the area of emotional and personal development, the best guidance the seminary formator can give is the wholesome witness of his own life. Seminarians need the example of outstanding priests who model a wholesome way of life in the challenging circumstances of contemporary society. Regularly coming together for prayer, recreation, and theological reflection encourages growth in priestly fraternity and enables priests to act more effectively as authentic role models. The entire seminary staff—composed of priests, consecrated men and women, and lay men and women—constitutes another significant group who can model collaboration for the seminarians. Ways to foster the unity of this larger circle should also be developed.</p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="224">§224 </span>The rector together with the coordinator of human formation should make provision for psychological and counseling services. He therefore ensures that those employed as counselors for seminarians are professionally licensed or certified; are well versed in and supportive of the Church’s expectations of seminarians, especially concerning celibacy; and will not encourage behaviors contrary to Church teachings. These services are made available to seminarians for their personal and emotional development as they prepare for the priesthood. The counseling that is given should be consistent with the policy and practice of the total seminary program.</p>
        <p>Counseling is often a helpful tool in human formation. Its role, however, should not be overestimated. While psychology and the human sciences are resources that can aid the process of human formation, they are not the same as human formation. Seminaries must draw up guidelines for psychologists, describing objectively those traits and attitudes that indicate satisfactory progress toward the priesthood and those that indicate a lack of the requisite qualities needed for growth in human formation. The basis for such guidelines are the qualities articulated in this <i>Program of Priestly Formation</i>. Seminarians in need of long-term therapy should avail themselves of such assistance before entering the seminary or should leave the seminary program until therapy has been completed. If such a departure occurs, there is to be no expectation of automatic readmission. A seminarian should not be considered for advancement to Holy Orders if he is engaged in long-term psychological therapy. Issues being addressed in counseling should be satisfactorily settled prior to the call to Holy Orders. Clear and prudent guidelines are necessary for fostering the personal, emotional, and psychosexual development of seminarians in the context of a wholesome community.</p>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible title1">SPIRITUAL DIMENSION</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="225">§225 </span>For every Christian, human formation leads to and finds its completion in spiritual formation. Human formation continues in conjunction with and in coordination with the spiritual, intellectual, and pastoral dimensions of formation. “Spiritual formation is directed at nourishing and sustaining communion with God and with our brothers and sisters, in the friendship of Jesus the Good Shepherd, and with an attitude of docility to the Holy Spirit. This intimate relationship forms the heart of the seminarian in that generous and sacrificial love that marks the beginning of pastoral charity.”<span class="footnumber">277</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 101.</span></p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="226">§226 </span>The basic principle of spiritual formation is expressed in <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i> and is a synthesis of the teachings in <i>Optatam Totius</i>: The seminarian is called “to live in intimate and unceasing union with God the Father through his Son Jesus Christ, in the Holy Spirit.”<span class="footnumber">278</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 45.</span> This is the foundational call to discipleship and conversion of heart. Those who aspire to be sent on mission, as the Apostles were, must first acquire the listening and learning heart of disciples. Jesus invited these Apostles to come to him before he sent them out to others. St. Augustine alluded to this double identity and commitment as disciple and apostle when he said to his people, “With you I am a Christian, for you I am a bishop.”<span class="footnumber">279</span><span class="footnote">St. Augustine, Sermo 46, 1-2.</span></p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="227">§227 </span>To live in intimate and unceasing union with God the Father through his Son Jesus Christ in the Holy Spirit is far more than a personal or individual relationship with the Lord; it is also a communion with the Church, which is his Body. The spirituality that belongs to those who are priests or preparing for priesthood is at one and the same time Trinitarian, Christological, pneumatological, and ecclesial. It is a spirituality of communion rooted in the mystery of the Triune God and lived out in practical ways in the mystery of ecclesial communion.</p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="228">§228 </span>The spirituality cultivated in the seminary is specifically priestly. Through the Sacraments of Initiation, seminarians already share in the Paschal Mystery of Jesus Christ with other members of the Church. They also aspire to become priests who are configured to Christ, Head and Shepherd of the Church, our great High Priest. The seminarian is invited to put everything he is and everything he has at the service of the Gospel, deepening his total self-gift through simplicity of life, celibacy and obedience. His interior life gradually draws him deeper into the priestly, self-sacrificial path of Jesus. Jesus is the one whose service finds its high point in giving his life as a ransom for the many,<span class="footnumber">280</span><span class="footnote">See Mk 10:45.</span> as the Good Shepherd who lays down his life for his sheep “so that they might have life and have it more abundantly,”<span class="footnumber">281</span><span class="footnote">Jn 10:10; see Jn 10:17-18.</span> and as the Bridegroom who loves his Bride, the Church, “and handed himself over for her.”<span class="footnumber">282</span><span class="footnote">Eph 5:25; see Eph 5:26-27.</span> Spiritual formation is about forming the heart so that it will interiorize the sentiments and ways of acting of Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, who always acted in communion with the Holy Spirit.</p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="229">§229 </span>Given these basic dimensions of priestly spirituality that are foundational to the program of spiritual formation in the seminary, the seminary should identify those characteristics and practices that foster its growth. It is a formation that includes the following:
    <ol type="a">
      <li><i>Eucharist</i>: Spiritual formation is first and foremost a participation in public worship of the Church that is itself a participation in the heavenly Liturgy offered by Christ, our great High Priest. “In the earthly liturgy we take part in a foretaste of that heavenly liturgy which is celebrated in the Holy City of Jerusalem toward which we journey as pilgrims, where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God, Minister of the holies and of the true tabernacle.”<span class="footnumber">283</span><span class="footnote"><i>Sacrosanctum Concilium</i>, no. 8; see Heb 8:2.</span> In the Eucharistic sacrifice, the seminarian learns to offer himself with Christ to the Father and receives spiritual sustenance, Christ’s own Flesh and Blood. In Holy Communion, he encounters Jesus Christ, crucified and risen, and opens himself to the transforming power of his self-giving and redeeming love. The Eucharist is the source of pastoral charity, the love that animates and directs those who walk in the footsteps of the Good Shepherd, who gives his life for his sheep so that they may live. As source and summit of the Christian life, the daily celebration of the Eucharist is the essential moment of the day.<span class="footnumber">284</span><span class="footnote">See CIC, c. 246 §1; CCEO, c. 346 §2, 2°. See <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 46; <i>Ecclesia de Eucharistia</i>.</span> “The priestly soul strives to make its own what is enacted on the altar of sacrifice. But this cannot be achieved except through priests themselves penetrating ever more intimately through prayer into the mystery of Christ.”<span class="footnumber">285</span><span class="footnote"><i>Presbyterorum Ordinis</i>, no. 14.</span></li>
      <li><i>Sacrament of Penance</i>: The Sacrament of Penance fosters the mature recognition of sin, continuous conversion of heart, growth in the virtues, and conformity to the mind of Christ. It is a school of compassion that teaches penitents how to live out God’s compassionate mercy in the world. The frequent celebration of the Sacrament of Penance is aided by the practice of a daily examination of conscience.<span class="footnumber">286</span><span class="footnote">See CIC, cc. 246 §4, 276 §2, 5°; CCEO, cc. 369 §1, 346 §2, 4°.</span></li>
      <li><i>Liturgy of the Hours</i>: Through the Liturgy of the Hours (or the Divine Praises, in the Eastern Catholic Churches), seminarians learn to pray with the Church and for the Church, assimilating the language of prayer of the Church that is pleasing to God and transformative, forming both mind and spirit. They unite themselves with the Body of Christ in unceasing praise and petition. This prayer prepares them for their lifelong ministry as priests who pray on behalf of the whole Church. It also cultivates a mind and heart attuned to the whole Body of Christ, its needs, its sufferings, its graces, and its hopes.<span class="footnumber">287</span><span class="footnote">See CIC, c. 246 §2; CCEO, c. 346 §2, 3°. See <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 48.</span></li>
      <li><i>Spiritual direction</i>: Biweekly meetings with an approved spiritual director is an essential part of spiritual direction, especially in arriving at the interiorization and integration needed for growth in sanctity, virtue, and readiness for Holy Orders. Seminaries should offer clear expectations regarding the frequency at which spiritual direction is scheduled.</li>
      <li><i>Bible</i>: “A relationship with the Word of God holds a preeminent place in the process of spiritual growth.”<span class="footnumber">288</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 103.</span> Receiving the Word of God proclaimed and preached in the Church and in the quiet and personal assimilation of that holy word in lectio divina enables those in formation to hear God’s communication to them as a transforming challenge and hope. To take on more fully the mind of Christ and to be steadily transformed by the Word of God, the seminarian should develop the habit of daily reflection on Sacred Scripture by daily meditation on the lectionary readings and/or other reflective reading of Sacred Scripture.<span class="footnumber">289</span><span class="footnote">See CCEO, c. 346 §2, 1°. See <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 47.</span></li>
      <li><i>Retreats and days of recollection</i>: Regular periods of more intensive prayer will be part of the seminary year.<span class="footnumber">290</span><span class="footnote">See CIC, 246 §5; CCEO, c. 346 §2, 6°.</span> “The annual retreat, a time of profound reflection in prolonged prayerful encounter with the Lord in an atmosphere of silence and recollection, must then be continued during the rest of the year in occasional periods of recollection and in daily prayer.”<span class="footnumber">291</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 108.</span></li>
      <li><i>Personal meditation</i>: “The heart of spiritual formation is personal union with Christ, which is born of, and nourished in, a particular way by prolonged and silent prayer.”<span class="footnumber">292</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 102.</span> The habit of daily prayer and meditation enables seminarians to acquire a personalized sense of how God’s salvation has taken hold of their lives and how they might respond to that great grace. This prayer happens in a context of silence and solitude in which they learn to be attuned to God’s movements in their lives. It grows and develops into a “contemplative attitude” that learns to find God in all things. It matures in such a way that it allows for a balanced and unified rhythm of life in action and contemplation, work and prayer, while providing the future priest with the strength, meaning, and focus he will need in his life.</li>
      <li><i>Praying with the Fathers of the Church</i>: Studying and meditating on the writings of the Fathers of both the East and the West provide “reliable sources of inspiration” to help address “the emergence of new currents of spirituality” that may be detrimental to the Christian faith or one’s vocation.<span class="footnumber">293</span><span class="footnote">Congregation for Catholic Education, Instruction on the Study of the Fathers of the Church in the Formation of Priests, November 10, 1989, in Origins 19:34 (January 25, 1990): 551.</span></li>
      <li><i>Devotions</i>: Devotional prayer, especially centered on Eucharistic Adoration, the Blessed Virgin Mary—in particular the Rosary— and the saints, assists seminarians in assimilating the mystery of Christ and hearing the invitation to live that mystery in the particular circumstances of their own life. Devotional prayer helps to sustain and place in its proper context affective communication with the Lord and his Church. It also helps them to connect with the rich cultural diversity of devotional life in the United States and to appreciate devotional practices of other cultures.<span class="footnumber">294</span><span class="footnote">See CIC, 246 §3; CCEO, c. 346 §2, 5°. See <i>Evangelii Gaudium</i>, nos. 122-126.</span></li>
      <li><i>Apostolic dimensions</i>: “Spiritual formation also involves seeking Christ in people.”<span class="footnumber">295</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 49.</span> Especially in a seminary context, seminarians are to learn how prayer is to be lived out in service of others, particularly the poor, the sick, sinners, unbelievers, and the stranger, but extended to all in the outreach of charity and mercy and in the quest for justice. Prayer is apostolic also in the sense that seminarians learn to pray for the needs of those they serve in order to teach others how to pray. Whatever growth and formation in prayer takes place, it is not simply meant for the personal enhancement of the seminarian but as a gift to be given in the course of his priestly mission and ministry for the benefit of the Church—for he is a servant of this body.</li>
      <li><i>Asceticism and penance</i>: Spiritual formation initiates seminarians to a path of voluntary renunciation and self-denial that makes them more available to the will of God and more available to their people. Asceticism and the practice of penance is a path of learning to embrace the Cross and, in an apostolic context, a way of rendering priests unafraid to bear their “share of hardship for the gospel with the strength that comes from God” (2 Tm 1:8).</li>
      <li><i>Obedience</i>: The obedience of those in spiritual formation for priesthood must be characterized by the willingness to hear God, who speaks through his Word and through his Church, and to answer his call with generosity. It is also a surrender of one’s own will for the sake of the larger mission. In this regard, the seminarian must develop a growing and deepening solidarity with the Church established by Christ; a solidarity with Church teaching so as to be able to present that teaching with conviction—having appropriated it as true; and a solidarity with one’s diocesan bishop or superior to strengthen and sustain Church unity.<span class="footnumber">296</span><span class="footnote">See CIC, cc. 260, 273, 601; CCEO, c. 346 §2, 7°, and 370.</span></li>
      <li><i>Celibacy</i>: Spiritual formation in celibacy cultivates the evangelical motivations for embracing this commitment and way of life: the undivided love of the Lord, the spousal love for the Church, apostolic availability, and the witness to God’s promises and Kingdom.<span class="footnumber">297</span><span class="footnote">See CIC, c. 247 §1. “It is especially important that the priest understand the theological motivation of the Church’s law on celibacy. Inasmuch as it is a law, it expresses the Church’s will, even before the will of the subject expressed by his readiness. But the will of the Church finds its ultimate motivation in the link between celibacy and sacred ordination, which configures the priest to Jesus Christ the head and spouse of the Church. The Church, as the spouse of Jesus Christ, wishes to be loved by the priest in the total and exclusive manner in which Jesus Christ her head and spouse loved her. Priestly celibacy, then, is the gift of self in and with Christ to his Church and expresses the priest’s service to the Church in and with the Lord.” <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 29. See also <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 50.</span> A man in formation for ministry must demonstrate the necessary freedom and affective maturity.<span class="footnumber">298</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 110.</span></li>
      <li><i>Simplicity of life</i>: Spiritual formation encourages a simple approach to the material goods of this world, cultivating a “spirit of poverty in practical ways.”<span class="footnumber">299</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 111.</span> Freed from excessive concern about possessions, priests and seminarians, particularly those in religious institutes and societies of apostolic life, are able to serve in an unencumbered way. To live with evangelical simplicity is to exercise responsible stewardship over God’s creation by using material goods in a way that is both responsive to the call of the Gospel and ecologically responsible.<span class="footnumber">300</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Laudato Si</i>’, nos. 216-221. “Living our vocation to be protectors of God’s handiwork is essential to a life of virtue; it is not an optional or a secondary aspect of our Christian experience.” <i>Laudato Si</i>’, no. 217.</span> The witness of a genuine simplicity of life and of detachment from riches<span class="footnumber">301</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Catechism of the Catholic Church</i>, no. 2544.</span> is especially important in the context of affluence in the United States. Spiritual directors and priest formators must be sensitive to seminarians’ stewardship of their own, the seminary’s, and the Church’s material resources. Spiritual formation for simplicity of life and stewardship flows directly from striving to have the mind of Christ Jesus, “who, though he was in the form of God, / did not regard equality with God something to be grasped. / Rather, he emptied himself” (Phil 2:6-7). This is the Lord Jesus who, again according to St. Paul, “for your sake . . . became poor although he was rich, so that by his poverty you might become rich” (2 Cor 8:9).</li>
      <li><i>Reconciliation</i>: Spiritual formation fosters a reconciling spirit in those who aspire to be priests in the spirit of Jesus, who prayed that “all might be one.” A peacemaking and nonviolent way of life marks out those who have been entrusted with the ministry of reconciliation (see 2 Cor 5:18). The power that is entrusted to God’s ministers, a power that takes many forms, must always be used for the good, peaceably and in a way that expresses the trust invested in God’s priests.</li>
      <li><i>Solidarity</i>: The post-synodal apostolic exhortation <i>Ecclesia in America</i> identified the critical importance of the path of solidarity for the Church in the Americas.<br>
        <blockquote>“Solidarity is thus the fruit of the communion which is grounded in the mystery of the Triune God, and in the Son of God who took flesh and died for all. It is expressed in Christian love which seeks the good of others, especially of those most in need.” For the particular Churches of the American continent, this is the source of a commitment to reciprocal solidarity and the sharing of the spiritual gifts and material goods with which God has blessed them, fostering in individuals a readiness to work where they are needed.<span class="footnumber">302</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ecclesia in America</i>, no. 52.</span></blockquote><br>This means that seminarians are to have a spiritual formation grounded in Trinitarian communion that leads them to solidarity with others, especially those most in need; to a commitment to justice and peace; to a reciprocal exchange of spiritual and material gifts; and to an authentic missionary spirit, expressed in a willingness to serve where needed.
      </li>
      <li><i>Solitude</i>: Spiritual formation must not neglect the art of “being alone with God,” moving the man from being alone or lonely to entering a holy solitude in communion with God.</li>
      <li><i>A life of discernment</i>: The <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i> describes well how all of these means of spiritual growth help the seminarian to establish a life of discernment: “The gradual inner growth along the journey of formation should principally be aimed at making the future priest a ‘man of discernment,’ able to read the reality of human life in the light of the Spirit.” This discernment applies first to one’s personal life: “It is necessary to integrate one’s own personal situation and history into the spiritual life. . . . Discerning one’s life according to the Gospel means cultivating every day a deep spiritual life, so as to receive it and interpret it with full responsibility and a growing trust in God, directing the heart towards him each day.” It extends ultimately to the pastoral life so “he will be able to choose, decide and act according to the will of God.” All of the means included here “help to cultivate the virtues of prudence and right judgment. In this ongoing path of discernment the priest will learn how to interpret and understand his own motivations, his gifts, his needs and his frailties, so as to ‘free himself from all disordered affections and, having removed them, to seek out and find the will of God in the ordering of his life with a view to the salvation of the soul.’”<span class="footnumber">303</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 43. Here the <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i> notes the particular value of the Ignatian rules of discernment.</span></li>
      <li><i>Ongoing spiritual formation</i>: The final goal of spiritual formation in the seminary is to establish attitudes, habits, and practices in the spiritual life that will continue after ordination. Spiritual formation in the seminary is meant to set the foundation for a lifetime of spiritual growth in priestly ministry.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="230">§230 </span>The development of sound and lasting habits and attitudes in the spiritual life is a challenging process. Intensive spiritual formation experiences— such as an extended time period more exclusively focused on the interior life, a thirty-day retreat, a summer program, and so on—are examples of facilitating this process and may be considered for possible inclusion and integration into the seminary program.</p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="231">§231 </span>Spiritual formation needs to be integrated with the other three dimensions of formation—the human, the intellectual, and the pastoral. The necessary growth in the theological and moral virtues involves both nature and grace. The necessary integration takes place when spiritual directors and priest formators work from a common vision of the relationship between grace and virtue. Spiritual formation also requires that the seminarian have a strong relational capacity. In other words, the seminarian must be able to enter into significant, even deep, relationships with other persons and with God, since he is to be a “man of communion.”<span class="footnumber">304</span><span class="footnote">“The Eucharist commits us to the poor. To receive in truth the Body and Blood of Christ given up for us, we must recognize Christ in the poorest.” <i>Catechism of the Catholic Church</i>, no. 1397.</span></p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="232">§232 </span>Intellectual formation contributes to spiritual formation by helping the seminarian grow in the love of the truth, who is the person of Jesus Christ. This love gives the seminarian the capacity to discern and understand his interior life within the life of the Church and her Tradition. Growth in knowledge of God and of his saving works can strengthen the seminarian’s faith, hope, and charity. Likewise, the study of the traditions and the experiences of faith among the saints and the People of God serves to deepen one’s own spiritual journey.</p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="233">§233 </span>Pastoral formation is intimately linked with spiritual formation. In the process of spiritual formation, men are formed to receive the love of God in such a way that they desire to share that love by making a gift of their entire lives. As their hearts are gradually formed in the image of Christ, the Good Shepherd and Bridegroom, their interior life becomes a source of pastoral charity that enables them to lay down their lives generously in service of others. “This intimate relationship forms the heart of the seminarian in that generous and sacrificial love that marks the beginning of pastoral charity.”<span class="footnumber">305</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 101.</span> In this the seminarian learns to eschew any false independence in his labors and to live the words of Jesus: “without me you can do nothing” (Jn 15:5).</p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="234">§234 </span>It is important that spiritual formation is integrated with the other three dimensions of formation such that all formation allows the future priest to embrace pastoral charity as central to his ministry.<span class="footnumber">306</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Presbyterorum Ordinis</i>, no. 14.</span> Human, intellectual, and pastoral formation are equally indispensable in developing the seminarian’s relationship and communion with God and his ability to communicate to others, in pastoral charity, God’s truth and love in the likeness of Jesus Christ, the Good Shepherd and eternal High Priest.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="235">§235 </span>One of the primary objectives of the propaedeutic stage is to provide an introduction to the spiritual life and to develop a solid foundation in the seminarian’s life of prayer. Those elements in the spiritual dimension to be achieved prior to beginning the discipleship stage include growth in prayer and the spiritual life (e.g., elementary discipline in public and private prayer, interest in and attention to spiritual direction, understanding of the importance of silence, and a growing habit of silence), growth in an understanding of the celibate life (e.g., ability to articulate the Church’s understanding of the promise of celibacy and the spiritual motivation for celibacy, growth in the virtue of chastity, and growth in the habit of healthy solitude), growth in the understanding of the priestly vocation, the ability to articulate a relationship with Jesus Christ, and growth in reading and meditating on Sacred Scripture.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="236">§236 </span>In the discipleship stage, the seminarian demonstrates a growing openness to the Holy Spirit as the primary agent of formation in his life; he recognizes God’s grace enabling him to grow and discern with the grateful assistance of his formators. The seminarian continues to learn from Christ the Good Shepherd to do as he does. His deepening friendship with Jesus Christ and his understanding of the Good Shepherd’s call to ordained ministry will allow him to enter the next stage confident in his vocation to the priesthood. He develops greater insight into why he feels God is calling him to the priesthood and why he desires priesthood.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="237">§237 </span>Spiritual benchmarks related to prayer and the spiritual life that the seminarian should achieve by the end of the discipleship stage include consistent participation in communal spiritual exercises and liturgies, including prayerful participation in the Mass and Divine Office (or the Divine Praises, in the Eastern Catholic Churches); a demonstrated habit of regular spiritual reading; the ability to speak with facility about God’s work in his life; and a habit of personal prayer, spiritual direction, and participation in the Sacrament of Penance.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="238">§238 </span>By the end of the discipleship stage, the seminarian is able to articulate his understanding and awareness of God’s call to him of a lifelong commitment to celibate chastity.<span class="footnumber">307</span><span class="footnote">This includes a growing understanding of the positive reasons for a lifelong commitment to celibate chastity. St. Paul VI articulates these as “a real participation in His [Christ’s] own unique priesthood. . . . Christ remained throughout His whole life in the state of celibacy, which signified His total dedication to the service of God and men.” Sacerdotalis Caelibatus (On the Celibacy of the Priest, 1967), nos. 19, 21; see also no. 23, <a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/paul-vi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_24061967_sacerdotalis.html" target="blank">www.vatican.va/content/paul-vi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_24061967_sacerdotalis.html</a>. In addition to raising matrimony to the dignity of a sacrament, Christ “has also opened a new way, in which the human creature adheres wholly and directly to the Lord, and is concerned only with Him and with His affairs” (Sacerdotalis Caelibatus, no. 20). The “free choice of sacred celibacy . . . stimulates to a charity which is open to all” and “manifests the virginal love of Christ for the Church” (Sacerdotalis Caelibatus, nos. 24, 26).</span> He continues to grow in the virtue of chastity. He has the ability to articulate and demonstrate appropriate boundaries with others, relating to all persons as beloved children of the Father, and possesses a solid understanding and desire of a habit of healthy solitude. He demonstrates a growing transparency in his relationship with Jesus Christ through his ability to describe this relationship to others in a meaningful way; he nurtures this relationship through a well-established habit of reading and meditating on Sacred Scripture.</p>

      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="239">§239 </span>The well-established friendship between the seminarian and Jesus Christ, which is necessarily characteristic of the man by the end of the configuration stage, is reflected in an internalized habit of reading and meditating on Sacred Scripture, as well as the ability to identify and communicate connections between meditation on Sacred Scripture, his relationship with Christ, and his personal spiritual growth. This friendship can be seen in his ability to live a simple life and articulate the reasons for it. He is able to recognize and articulate concretely God’s grace active in his life and the lives of others, identifying in common life that communio which enriches and deepens his life with Christ for the sake of others.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="240">§240 </span>He demonstrates an ability to maintain fidelity to the Liturgy of the Hours (or the Divine Praises, in the Eastern Catholic Churches), daily Mass, and personal prayer, both in the seminary or religious house and away from those structures.

He can assist others in their spiritual growth through a prayerful familiarity with God’s Word and the spiritual Tradition of the Church.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="241">§241 </span>By the end of the configuration stage, the seminarian can live the virtue of chastity and can communicate a free and joyful lifelong commitment to celibate chastity. With the ever-deepening awareness of his own humanity, with its gifts and limitations, he can recognize common and personal causes of loneliness and can develop a habit of healthy approaches to these challenges and improve his habit of solitude.<span class="footnumber">308</span><span class="footnote">Healthy habits in this area are crucial to his future well-being as a priest. “The Causes and Context data indicate that abuse is most likely to occur at times of stress, loneliness, and isolation. Such stressful or challenging situations triggered the desire in some priests to form inappropriate relationships with others—such relationships were most often with adults, but sometimes with minors.” John Jay College Research Team, The Causes and Context of Sexual Abuse of Minors by Catholic Priests in the United States, 1950-2010: A Report Presented to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (Washington, DC: USCCB, 2011), 120.</span></p>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible title1">INTELLECTUAL DIMENSION</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="261">§261 </span>There is a reciprocal relationship between spiritual and intellectual formation. The intellectual life nourishes the spiritual life, but the spiritual also opens vistas of understanding, in accordance with the classical adage credo ut intelligam (I believe in order to understand). Intellectual formation is integral to what it means to be human.</p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="262">§262 </span>“To ensure the adequate intellectual formation of future priests, all disciplines must be taught in such a way as to make their intimate connection stand out clearly, avoiding fragmentation. It is to be a unified, integral journey, in which each subject is an important ‘tile in the mosaic’ for presenting the mystery of Christ and the Church, and for allowing an authentic Christian vision of man and the world to mature.”<span class="footnumber">332</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 153.</span></p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="263">§263 </span>The basic principle of intellectual formation for seminarians is noted in <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>: “For the salvation of their brothers and sisters they should seek an ever deeper knowledge of the divine mysteries.” <span class="footnumber">333</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 51.</span> Disciples are learners. The first task of intellectual formation is to acquire a personal knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the fullness and completion of God’s Revelation and the one Teacher. This saving knowledge is not acquired only once but rather is continuously appropriated and deepened, so that it becomes more and more part of the disciple. Seminary intellectual formation assumes and prolongs the catechesis and mystagogia that is to be part of every Christian’s journey of faith. At the same time, this knowledge is not simply for personal possession but is destined to be shared in the community of faith; that is why it is “for the salvation of their brothers and sisters.” Intellectual formation has an apostolic and missionary purpose and finality.</p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="264">§264 </span>In the seminary program, intellectual formation culminates in a deepened understanding of the mysteries of faith that is pastorally oriented toward effective priestly ministry, especially preaching, which is “the touchstone for judging a pastor’s closeness and ability to communicate to his people.”<span class="footnumber">334</span><span class="footnote"><i>Evangelii Gaudium</i>, no. 135.</span> This understanding, however, requires previous intellectual formation and academic integrity as foundational. The overall goal of every stage of seminary formation is to prepare a seminarian who is widely knowledgeable about the human condition, deeply engaged in a process of understanding Divine Revelation, and adequately skilled in communicating his knowledge to as many people as possible. Moreover, continuing education after ordination is a necessity for effective ministry.</p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="265">§265 </span>Intellectual formation must be directed to the ecclesial dimensions of priestly formation, namely, the teaching office (munus docendi) of the priesthood. The doctrinal, educational, catechetical, and apologetical aspects of training are to prepare the seminarian to be a faithful, loyal, and authentic teacher of the Gospel. As a man of the Church, the priest preaches and teaches in fidelity to the Magisterium, particularly the Holy Father and the diocesan bishop. The intellectual formation program must emphasize the intrinsic relationship between the knowledge gained in theological preparation and the ecclesial dimensions of priestly service, since the education of a priest is never seen in isolation from the Tradition of the Church.</p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="266">§266 </span>The context of intellectual formation in the United States during the twenty-first century is important to note, because it highlights the specific challenges that both seminaries and seminarians face in the process of intellectual formation. Among the elements of context are the following:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Many men approach the seminary with a significant educational background. They are, however, often narrowly educated; that is, they may have great expertise in a particular area and have a high level of technical training but lack a wide background. Often lacking is education in the humanities, which would enable them to study theology effectively and make pastoral connections with the lives of the people whom they will serve.</li>
      <li>Older men approach the seminary with considerable life experience, but they may have lost contact with formal patterns of study in school. Their age may seem to warrant that they be moved through the seminarian program quickly, or that they be given a program that has been reduced in expectations. This latter trend, however, is to be resisted.</li>
      <li>Men with an international background may arrive at the seminary with a limited knowledge of the English language as well as a limited understanding of US culture. These limitations present significant challenges for teaching and learning. Unless the seminarian has sufficient familiarity with language and culture, his study of theology will be severely impeded.<span class="footnumber">335</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Guidelines for Receiving Pastoral Ministers in the United States</i> cited earlier in the propaedeutic stage section for more information on reception and orientation of men from international backgrounds.</span></li>
      <li>Men coming from a US cultural context, even though they may be young and have had exposure to the liberal arts in college, may bring with them the limitations of the culture’s understanding of the human person as well as the limitations of a philosophical milieu that is suspicious of or even rejects enduring, absolute moral values and objective truths. Unless these men are grounded in an adequate philosophical and theological anthropology, they will struggle to make sense of their theological studies and their application in pastoral practice.</li>
      <li>Men apply to seminary programs with backgrounds of varied religious experiences and varied levels of catechetical formation.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="267">§267 </span>“Intellectual formation is a part of the integral formation of the priest. Moreover, it serves his pastoral ministry and has an impact upon his human and spiritual formation, which draw rich nourishment from it.”<span class="footnumber">336</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 117.</span> Intellectual formation applies not only to a comprehensive understanding of the mysteries of the Catholic faith, but also to an ability to explain and even defend the reasoning that supports those truths. In this way, intellectual formation provides those who are being formed spiritually with a knowledge of the Lord and his ways, which they embrace in faith. Finally, intellectual formation through the study of theology enables priests to contemplate, share, and communicate the mysteries of faith with others. In this way, it has an essentially pastoral orientation.</p>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible title2">The Propaedeutic Stage</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="268">§268 </span>The propaedeutic stage is “an ideal opportunity to acquire an initial and overall familiarity with Christian doctrine by studying the <i>Catechism of the Catholic Church</i>.”<span class="footnumber">337</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 59.</span> Teaching new seminarians the basics of priestly identity and spirituality is also a chief aim of the intellectual formation of this stage. Seminarians should obtain an introductory knowledge of the Bible that equips them to thoughtfully read and pray with Sacred Scripture. Training in intercultural competency, including beginning to learn a new language to meet the pastoral needs of the diocese, should be included in the intellectual formation of seminarians.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="269">§269 </span>Other areas of study that support this broad foundational doctrinal formation could include introduction to the documents of the Second Vatican Council and other principal documents of the Magisterium, introductory reading of the Church Fathers and Doctors, and study of the lives the saints and blesseds (especially American saints and blesseds).<span class="footnumber">338</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 157.</span> In addition, intellectual formation could begin to familiarize the seminarian with the great schools of spiritual theology and the spiritual masters.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="270">§270 </span>For international seminarians, English-language study (for those for whom English is not the primary language) and an acculturation program should be completed prior to beginning the propaedeutic stage. Continued study of English and acculturation during the propaedeutic stage is also vital. It is helpful, and sometimes necessary, that spiritual direction and some human formation during this stage be provided in the first or primary language of the seminarian to allow for adequate vocational discernment.<span class="footnumber">339</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 27.</span></p> <button type="button" class="collapsible title3">Propaedeutic Stage Benchmarks</button>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible title2">The Discipleship Stage</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="272">§272 </span>A great number of seminarians enter the discipleship stage with a wealth of education and practical experience, yet many younger men enter discipleship stage with minimal or no higher education. The seminary intellectual program must meet the various needs of these men. All men in the discipleship stage must receive philosophical formation to train their minds in right reason and prepare them to study theology. In addition, as future pastors and leaders, these seminarians need to be broadly educated in order to develop as Christian men and engage with society. Thus, the discipleship stage envisions benchmarks for intellectual formation with two aspects: a broad grasp of the liberal arts and sciences, and particular knowledge of philosophy. Seminarians who enter the discipleship stage in possession of a broader intellectual formation (for example, with an undergraduate degree or more extensive education) may have already met the benchmarks for the liberal arts and sciences and will not need formation in this aspect but will focus on philosophy. Seminarians beginning the discipleship stage with minimal education beyond secondary school will need to pursue a liberal arts education as well as philosophical studies and should achieve a baccalaureate degree before beginning the configuration stage. The discipleship stage program promotes intellectual excellence and takes necessary steps to help seminarians to achieve it.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="273">§273 </span>Men who enter seminary without a substantial liberal arts education follow a twofold course of intellectual formation. They first pursue the liberal arts, through which they acquire a sense of the great human questions and the responses to them presented in the arts and sciences. Then they also synthesize and organize their study of the liberal arts through the study of philosophy, which also serves as a preparation for the study of theology.</p> <button type="button" class="collapsible title3">Liberal Arts</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="274">§274 </span>A sound liberal arts education for seminarians provides multiple benefits. The study of the natural world and of humanity in all its historical and cultural diversity represents a significant value in its own right. Such an education encourages intellectual curiosity, promotes critical thought, and fosters disciplined habits of study, but above all it aims to hand on the truths about God and his creation that are the foundation of civilization. A liberal arts education also teaches seminarians to communicate with others in a clear and effective way.</p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="275">§275 </span>A liberal arts education gives seminarians an introduction to the wider range of human learning. Studies in mathematics and natural sciences; in the social and behavioral sciences; in history, literature, foreign languages—both ancient (Latin and Greek) and modern; and in communication skills, music, and the fine arts all define the content of a liberal arts curriculum.</p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="276">§276 </span>A liberal arts education also has a special value as a preparation for the study of theology. The liberal arts have traditionally provided seminarians with an understanding of the cultural roots of their faith. By understanding the human sciences, they can comprehend better the world in which God acts. By grasping how faith and culture have interacted in the past, they gain some insight into the working of God’s plan in larger historical events.</p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="277">§277 </span>The curriculum should also strive to take into consideration contemporary issues of the day in intellectual, cultural, social, economic, and political life as they pertain to moral and religious topics. Such an approach stimulates seminarians to deeper study by building on current knowledge and interests. The authentic social doctrine of the Church on such issues should be clearly and cogently presented.<span class="footnumber">342</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 172.</span> The curriculum should introduce seminarians to the basic teachings of the faith as well as to the richness and diversity of the wisdom attained in the Catholic intellectual tradition.</p>
      </div> <button type="button" class="collapsible title3">Philosophy</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="278">§278 </span>All seminarians in the discipleship stage study philosophy. Men who come to the discipleship stage in possession of a broader intellectual formation must engage in the full philosophical intellectual formation program outlined below. The study of philosophy is central to the intellectual formation of seminarians. The temptation to abbreviate or circumvent requirements for seminarians in these circumstances must be avoided.</p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="279">§279 </span>“The study of philosophy is fundamental and indispensable to the structure of theological studies and to the formation of candidates for the priesthood [or seminarians]. It is not by chance that the curriculum of theological studies is preceded by a time of special study of philosophy.”<span class="footnumber">343</span><span class="footnote"><i>Fides et Ratio</i>, no. 62.</span> In priestly formation, at least two full years must be dedicated to the philosophical disciplines, which corresponds to the two-year period of the discipleship stage and composes a major aspect of intellectual formation.<span class="footnumber">344</span><span class="footnote">See CIC, c. 250; CCEO, c. 348 §1.</span> The particular focus of intellectual formation, as well as the other dimensions of formation during this period, is to help the seminarian deepen his identity as a disciple of Jesus Christ.</p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="280">§280 </span>There is an “intimate bond which ties theological work to the philosophical search for truth.”<span class="footnumber">345</span><span class="footnote"><i>Fides et Ratio</i>, no. 63.</span> It is essential that seminarians develop an understanding of the relationship between faith and reason and of the relationship and interaction between philosophy and theology, especially the ways they mutually enrich one another. “A proper philosophical training is vital, not only because of the links between the great philosophical questions and the mysteries of salvation which are studied in theology under the guidance of the higher light of faith, but also vis-à-vis an extremely widespread cultural situation which emphasizes subjectivism as a criterion and measure of truth: Only a sound philosophy can help candidates for the priesthood to develop a reflective awareness of the fundamental relationship that exists between the human spirit and truth, that truth which is revealed to us fully in Jesus Christ.”<span class="footnumber">346</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 52.</span></p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="281">§281 </span>The study of philosophy is not just part of intellectual formation but is also connected to human, spiritual, and pastoral formation. Issues about priestly identity and about the apostolic and missionary dimensions of priestly ministry “are closely linked to the question about the nature of truth.” Philosophy serves “as a guarantee of that ‘certainty of truth’ which is the only firm basis for a total giving of oneself to Jesus and to the Church.”<span class="footnumber">347</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 52.</span></p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="282">§282 </span>The seminary philosophy program of studies should be balanced, comprehensive, integrated, and coherent. The philosophy program must include substantial studies in the history of philosophy, treating of ancient, medieval, modern, and contemporary philosophy.
        <ol type="a">
          <li>The study of the history of philosophy helps seminarians understand philosophical issues as they have developed in the Western philosophical tradition and, more particularly, in the Catholic intellectual tradition, which has been both shaped by and contributed to the shape of the Western philosophical tradition. This historical approach to the study of philosophy aids in the “integration of philosophical studies . . . [through] a specific ‘philosophical methodology.’”<span class="footnumber">348</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 159.</span> The knowledge of philosophy, with its powerful impact on theology and theologians, is necessary in order to appreciate the richness of our theological Tradition.</li>
          <li>At the same time, philosophy prepares seminarians for priestly ministry. By living more reflectively in the historical Catholic intellectual tradition, seminarians are better equipped for their ministry of teaching the faith, better prepared to engage contemporary culture, and better prepared for the “evangelization of culture” that is integral to the new evangelization. In this regard, some treatment of American philosophy or social thought is also helpful for seminarians in understanding the dynamics of contemporary society in the United States.<span class="footnumber">349</span><span class="footnote">For example, see the following resources from the USCCB: Bishops’ Program for Social Reconstruction (1919); The Challenge of Peace (1983); Economic Justice for All (1986); Called to Global Solidarity (1997); Responsibility, Rehabilitation, and Restoration: A Catholic Perspective on Crime and Criminal Justice (2000); Global Climate Change: A Plea for Dialogue, Prudence and the Common Good (2001); Strangers No Longer: Together on a Journey of Hope (2003); and Forming Consciences for Faithful Citizenship (2015). Pontifical Biblical Commission, The Bible and Morality: Biblical Roots of Christian Conduct (2008), is also a resource.</span></li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="283">§283 </span>The philosophy program must include the study of logic, epistemology, philosophy of nature, metaphysics, natural theology, anthropology, and ethics:
        <ol type="a">
          <li>The study of logic helps seminarians to develop their critical and analytical abilities and become clearer thinkers who will be better able rationally to present, discuss, and defend the truths of the faith.</li>
          <li>The study of epistemology, the investigation of the nature and properties of knowledge, helps seminarians see “that human knowledge is capable of gathering from contingent reality objective and necessary truths,”<span class="footnumber">350</span><span class="footnote">Congregation for Catholic Education, The Study of Philosophy in Seminaries (1972).</span> while recognizing also the limits of human knowledge. Moreover, it reinforces their understanding of the relationship between reason and Revelation. They come to appreciate the power of reason to know the truth; yet as they confront the limits of the powers of human reason, they are opened to look to Revelation for a fuller knowledge of those truths that exceed the power of human reason.</li>
          <li>The study of the philosophy of nature—which treats of fundamental principles like substance, form, matter, causality, motion, and the soul—provides seminarians a foundation for the study of metaphysics, natural theology, anthropology, and ethics.</li>
          <li>The study of metaphysics helps seminarians to explore fundamental issues concerning the nature of reality and to see that reality and truth transcend the empirical. “A philosophy which shuns metaphysics would be radically unsuited to the task of mediation in the understanding of Revelation.”<span class="footnumber">351</span><span class="footnote"><i>Fides et Ratio</i>, no. 83.</span> As the seminarian confronts the questions about being itself, he gains a deeper understanding and appreciation of God as the source of all being and gains some sense of how profound is this truth. A strong background in metaphysics also gives him the structure and ability to discuss certain theological concepts that depend on metaphysics for their articulation and explanation.</li>
          <li>The study of natural theology, which treats of the existence of God and the attributes of God by means of the natural light of reason, provides a foundation for the seminarian’s study of theology and the knowledge of God by means of Revelation.</li>
          <li>The study of philosophical anthropology helps seminarians understand “the authentic spirituality of man, leading to a theocentric ethic, transcending earthly life, and at the same time open to the social dimension of man.”<span class="footnumber">352</span><span class="footnote">See Congregation for Catholic Education, The Study of Philosophy in Seminaries (1972).</span> The philosophical study of the human “person, his fulfillment in intersubjectivity, his destiny, his inalienable rights, [and] his ‘nuptial character’ as one of the primary elements which is expressive of human nature and constitutive of society”<span class="footnumber">353</span><span class="footnote">Congregation for Catholic Education, Directives Regarding the Formation of Seminarians for Ministry to Marriage and Family (1995), no. 21, <a href="https://www.usccb.org/beliefs-and-teachings/vocations/priesthood/priestly-formation/upload/marriage.pdf" target="blank">www.usccb.org/beliefs-and-teachings/vocations/priesthood/priestly-formation/upload/marriage.pdf</a>.</span> provides a foundation for the seminarian’s study of theological anthropology.</li>
          <li>The study of ethics, which treats of general principles of ethical decision making, provides seminarians with a solid grounding in themes like conscience, freedom, law, responsibility, virtue, and guilt. Ethics also considers the common good and virtue of solidarity as central to Christian social political philosophy.

        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="284">§284 </span>“Philosophical instruction must be grounded in the perennially valid philosophical heritage and also take into account philosophical investigation over the course of time.

In articulating the mind of the Fathers of the Second Vatican Council on this point, the Congregation for Catholic Education, in its document on The Study of Philosophy in Seminaries, observed that “the repeated recommendations of the Church about the philosophy of St. Thomas Aquinas remain fully justified and still valid. In this philosophy the first principles of natural truth are clearly and organically enunciated and harmonized with revelation. Within it also is enclosed that creative dynamism which, as biographers attest, marked the teaching of St. Thomas and which must also characterize the teaching of those who desire to follow his footsteps in a continual and renewed synthesizing of the valid conclusions received from tradition with new conquests of human thought.” “Philosophy in Seminaries,” Origins 1, no. 39 (March 16, 1972): 659.</span> Especially in the courses on the history of philosophy, there should be a significant treatment of St. Thomas’s thought, along with its ancient sources and its later development. The fruitful relationship between philosophy and theology in the Christian tradition should be explored through studies in Thomistic thought as well as the thought of other great Christian theologians who were also great philosophers. These include certain Fathers of the Church, medieval Doctors, and recent Christian thinkers in the Western and Eastern traditions.<span class="footnumber">358</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Fides et Ratio</i>, no. 74.</span></p>

Theology courses in the discipleship stage should study the themes contained in the <i>Catechism of the Catholic Church</i>, including courses on Catholic doctrine, liturgy and the sacraments, Catholic morality, Christian prayer, and Sacred Scripture.

In addition, education in rhetoric and communications as well as language study is appropriate. Latin and Greek are especially important, since competence in these languages is necessary for graduate theological studies. The study of Spanish or other pastoral languages should be included in the course of studies throughout the period of priestly formation, including the discipleship stage.</p>

Regional accrediting agencies require adequate proficiency in the English language as demonstrated by a TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language).

        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="291">§291 </span>Ultimately, intellectual formation in the seminary program centers on theology as a search for “an ever deeper knowledge of the divine mysteries.”<span class="footnumber">361</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 51.</span> This kind of theological study, which far exceeds a purely technical approach to “religious phenomena,” unfolds in the following ways:
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Theology in seminary intellectual formation is truly to be fides quaerens intellectum, faith seeking understanding.<span class="footnumber">362</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 53.</span> This direction is not the same as the approach of religious studies or the history of religions. The seminary study of theology begins in faith and ends in faith, as should all true theological inquiry and study.</li>
          <li>In a seminary or priestly formation context, the study of theology is oriented to one’s own faith and also to the faith of others. In other words, the study of theology is apostolically motivated. “For the salvation of their brothers and sisters they should seek an ever deeper knowledge of the divine mysteries.”<span class="footnumber">363</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 51.</span></li>
          <li>At the same time, this study of theology, as we have already noted, enriches and expands the personal faith of the seminarian studying it.<span class="footnumber">364</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 53.</span></li>
          <li>When theology is studied in the context of priestly formation, it cannot be detached from other human knowledge. In fact, it is to be integrated with other elements of human understanding, especially philosophy and the human sciences.<span class="footnumber">365</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 53.</span></li>
          <li>The seminary study of theology, because it begins in faith and ends in faith, must also flow from prayer and lead to prayer.<span class="footnumber">366</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 54.</span></li>
          <li>In a particular way, the theology studied in preparation for priestly ministry must find integration and focus in the liturgy, the celebration of the Mystery of Christ.</li>
          <li>Because theology studied in light of priestly mission and ministry must be directed to a practical wisdom, it must offer a complete and unified vision of the truths of faith.<span class="footnumber">367</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 54.</span> This wisdom and unified vision, then, can be conveyed in the priest’s preaching and allow him to bring the Word of God into dialogue with the contemporary human situation.<span class="footnumber">368</span><span class="footnote">See USCCB, Fulfilled in Your Hearing: The Homily in the Sunday Assembly (Washington, DC: USCCB, 1982), 13.</span></li>
          <li>Because theology is rooted in the Church’s faith and serves the faith of the Church, it must be studied in complete and faithful communion with the Magisterium.<span class="footnumber">369</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 55.</span></li>
          <li>Theology studied in a seminary and destined to contribute to the mission of the Church through priestly ministry must necessarily be concerned about restoring Christian unity. Theological studies must impart an adequate grasp of the Catholic principles of ecumenism. <span class="footnumber">370</span><span class="footnote">See Second Vatican Council, Unitatis Redintegratio (1964), nos. 2-4.</span> The ecumenical imperative that flows from the prayer of Christ for his flock and the renewed vision of the Second Vatican Council demand this focus.</li>
          <li>Theology’s theoretical and practical dimensions in priestly mission and ministry mean that it must be rigorous in its orientation, both academically and pastorally.<span class="footnumber">371</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, nos. 55-56.</span></li>
          <li>Finally, the study of theology must be an initiation into a lifelong study of the truths of faith. If the priest is to be a teacher, he must first be a student who continuously pursues an understanding of the faith to which he commits himself and invites his people.</li>

Moreover, an understanding of the moral sense of Sacred Scripture should be developed<span class="footnumber">401</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Catechism of the Catholic Church</i>, nos. 115-118.</span> to prepare future priests for preaching on Christian morality. The preparation of future priests to be ministers of the Sacrament of Penance should also be kept in mind in the teaching of moral theology. Finally, the contribution of the natural and human sciences to moral theology should be considered.</p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="332">§332 </span>It is vital that the intellectual dimension in teaching moral theology be integrated with the pastoral dimension in applying moral theology to the lives of the People of God. Pastoral ministry requires more than the presentation of moral principles. Helping seminarians understand this is critical to formation in pastoral charity. Priests are called upon to assist the faithful in the formation of a sound moral conscience in accord with Sacred Scripture, Tradition, and magisterial teaching. This formation will enable each person to grow in authentic prudence and virtuous Christian acts in the midst of difficult and at times oppressive circumstances. The formation of priests in moral theology should intersect with formation in compassionate listening and in thoughtful counseling, with the pastoral goal of gently but consistently fostering the love of God and neighbor. This is especially important in the areas of sexuality and family life.</p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="333">§333 </span>The importance of a clear grasp of the principles of health care ethics cannot be overestimated for the future priest in the contemporary culture. Special attention during his preparation should be given to the fundamental respect for human life from conception to natural death and to the moral evils of and pastoral means of addressing contraception, in vitro fertilization, abortion, and euthanasia.</p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="334">§334 </span>The teaching of sexual morality must be thorough and unambiguous in its presentation of the authentic teaching of the Church in sexual moral matters—presuming a mature biological and basic social scientific understanding of human sexuality. Seminarians must be prepared to engage the contemporary world in dialogue regarding the complex issues of sexual morality and gender ideology. This is a matter of special import since the seminarian’s formation in celibate chastity includes the intellectual assent to, and embrace of, the Church’s moral teachings in all matters of sexuality.</p>
        <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="335">§335 </span>The social doctrine of the Church must be presented in its entirety with appropriate principles of reflection, criteria for judgment, and norms for pastoral practice.

  <button type="button" class="collapsible title1">PASTORAL DIMENSION</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="366">§366 </span>All four dimensions of formation are interwoven and go forward concurrently. Still, in a certain sense, pastoral formation is the culmination of the entire formation process. “The whole formation imparted to candidates for the priesthood aims at preparing them to enter into communion with the charity of Christ the good shepherd”;<span class="footnumber">430</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 57.</span> therefore “priestly formation must be permeated by a pastoral spirit.”<span class="footnumber">431</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 119.</span></p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="367">§367 </span>The goal of pastoral formation is to form shepherds of God’s People; this goal requires men who are not self-centered, aloof, judgmental, or self-imposing but instead are characterized by a “serene openness” and capable of listening and collaboration. True shepherds must have a desire to understand the hearts of others and engage in attentive accompaniment.<span class="footnumber">432</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 120. “The pastoral care of the faithful demands that the priest have a solid formation and interior maturity.” <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 41.</span></p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="368">§368 </span>In virtue of the sacramental character of Holy Orders, a priest is able to stand and act in the community in the name and person of Jesus Christ, Head and Shepherd of the Church. The fruitfulness of this sacramental character requires the personal and pastoral formation of the priest, who appropriates “the mind of Christ” and effectively communicates the mysteries of faith through his human personality as a bridge, through his personal witness of faith rooted in his spiritual life, and through his knowledge of faith. These dimensions of formation converge in pastoral formation.</p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="369">§369 </span>The basic principle of pastoral formation is enunciated in <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>: “The whole training of the students should have as its object to make them true shepherds of souls after the example of our Lord Jesus Christ, teacher, priest, and shepherd.”<span class="footnumber">433</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 57, citing <i>Optatam Totius</i>, no. 4.</span> To be a true “shepherd of souls” means to stand with and for Christ in the community, the Christ who teaches, sanctifies, and guides or leads the community. The grace to be a shepherd comes with ordination. That grace, however, calls for the priest’s personal commitment to develop the knowledge and skills to teach and preach well, to celebrate the sacraments both properly and prayerfully, and to respond to people’s needs as well as to take initiatives in the community that holy servant leadership requires. Developing this knowledge and these skills while still in the initial stages of formation enables him as a priest to assume the role of a shepherd, who learns to recognize God at work in the lives of his flock and who, ever present to them as a “man of communion,” directs the flock to Christ.<span class="footnumber">434</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 119.</span></p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="370">§370 </span>The aim of pastoral formation—the formation of a “true shepherd” who teaches, sanctifies, and governs or leads—implies that such formation must include a number of essential elements:
    <ol type="a">
      <li><i>Proclamation of the Word</i>: Pastoral formation needs to emphasize the proclamation of God’s Word, which indeed is the first task of the priest.<span class="footnumber">435</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Presbyterorum Ordinis</i>, no. 4.</span> This proclamation is aimed at the spiritual nourishment of the people and the conversion of sinners and is rooted in the seminarian’s or preacher’s ability to listen deeply to the lived experiences and realities of the faithful. This listening is followed by the preacher’s ability to interpret those lived experiences in the light of Sacred Scripture and the Church’s Tradition.<span class="footnumber">436</span><span class="footnote">See USCCB, Fulfilled in Your Hearing, 20; USCCB Committee on CCLV, Preaching the Mystery of Faith. See also St. John Paul II, letter to Archbishop John L. May, president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, August 8, 1987; Notes on the Correct Way to Present Jews and Judaism in Preaching and Catechesis in the Roman Catholic Church (1985); We Remember: A Reflection on the Shoah (1998).</span><br>Understanding this intersection of God’s Word and human experiences, the seminarian as preacher initiates a lifelong mission and ministry of bringing God’s Word to the world through preaching and teaching. This requires that the seminarian couple the deepest convictions of faith with the development of his communication skills, so that God’s Word may be effectively expressed.</li>
      <li><i>The sacramental dimension</i>: The celebration of the sacraments is central to the priest’s ministry. Although the seminarian cannot celebrate the sacraments as a priest does, he can accompany priests who do, and he can prepare those who participate in them. In this way, he begins to have a sense of what his sacramental ministry will entail. He will come to appreciate the sacraments as part of his future public ministry for the salvation of souls and understand more clearly how the Church’s sacraments, especially Penance and the Eucharist, nourish and sustain God’s people.</li>
      <li><i>Ecclesial formation</i>: All pastoral formation, on the universal, diocesan, and parochial levels, must be profoundly ecclesial and missionary in nature. Notwithstanding the specific situation of seminarians of an institute of consecrated life or society of apostolic life, diocesan seminarians must be familiarized with the local Church that they will serve and especially with the priests, with whom they will be co-workers with the bishop.<br>This dimension of pastoral formation means not only absorbing information about the local Church and presbyterate but, more importantly, cultivating bonds of affective communion and learning how to be at home in the place where one will serve and with the priests with whom one will serve.<span class="footnumber">437</span><span class="footnote">“The example of priests who have preceded the candidates into the priesthood will be a great help and incentive. This will include the elderly, the pastors who lead the Diocese, as well as the emeritus Bishops. It is a matter of making the ‘pastoral tradition’ of the local Church known and appreciated, the better to ease their future entry into pastoral life, for it is there that they will be incardinated and exercise the ministry.” <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 123.</span> Seminarians should see their future priestly assignments as something wider than their own preference and choice and as a sharing in a far wider vision of the needs of the local Church. At the same time, seminarians must understand that their hearts and minds should bear a concern for the Universal Church as well.<span class="footnumber">438</span><span class="footnote">“Seminarians ought to be moved by an authentically Catholic spirit. While loving their own Diocese sincerely, they ought to be open to placing themselves at the service of the Universal Church or of other particular Churches.” <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 123. See CIC, c. 257 §1; CCEO, c. 352 §3.</span><br>Lastly, it is necessary that all priests have the heart of missionaries. <span class="footnumber">439</span><span class="footnote">See St. John Paul II, Redemptoris Missio, no. 67.</span> The Church is truest to her identity when she is an evangelizing Church, because the very nature of the Church is missionary.<span class="footnumber">440</span><span class="footnote">See Second Vatican Council, Ad Gentes Divinitus (Decree on the Church’s Mission Activity), in Austin Flannery, ed., Vatican Council II: Volume 1: The Conciliar and Post Conciliar Documents, new rev. ed. (Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 1996), no. 2; <i>Evangelii Gaudium</i>, no. 19.</span> Seminarians must be taught the concern for all Churches and people and should be given an opportunity to become acquainted with the work of the Pontifical Mission Societies, the Missionary Congregations of Religious, the home missions, and the missionary tradition over the centuries. An exposure to the Church’s missionary work during the years of formation can be beneficial to the seminarian, his discernment, and his future ministry.</li>
      <li><i>The community dimension</i>: Pastoral formation must initiate seminarians to the care, guidance, and leadership that are extended to a community. The pastor is to be a man of communion and the shepherd of a flock. In the context of individualism in the United States, the concern is that “pastoral formation” and “pastoral care” might otherwise be limited to one-to-one contact.<br>Pastoral ministry is primarily directed to a community and then to individuals within that community. Seminarians need to learn how to integrate and make available in service to God’s People all the formation they have received from all dimensions. This means the acquisition of certain skills, for example, an ability to communicate the mysteries of faith in clear and readily comprehensible language<span class="footnumber">441</span><span class="footnote">See CIC, c. 255; CCEO, c. 352 §2.</span> using media and technology appropriate to the social context.<br>At the same time, pastoral formation means more than acquiring skills. It signifies a level of personal development, fitting for a priest who acts in the person of Jesus Christ, Head and Shepherd, Servant and Spouse. Effective ministry means, for example, the cultivation of a flexibility of spirit that enables the priest to relate to people across a number of different cultures and theological and ecclesial outlooks. Formators must help the seminarian put on both the mind and heart of Christ, the Good Shepherd,<span class="footnumber">442</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 58.</span> including exposing him to cultural and linguistic diversity. This exposure enables him to more fully welcome newcomers to the culturally rich society in which we live, while at the same time encouraging these newcomers to maintain the richness of their own cultural identity.<span class="footnumber">443</span><span class="footnote">Useful resources for formation in cultural competency are noted in the section on the propaedeutic stage.</span></li>
      <li><i>Collaboration with others</i>: Pastoral formation must give the seminarian the experience of working with various leaders within the Church, such as permanent deacons, the laity, and those in the state of consecrated life, so as to prepare him for fruitful collaboration with others as a priest.<span class="footnumber">444</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 119.</span></li>
      <li>Catholic education: Pastoral formation must help seminarians develop an awareness and appreciation of the necessity of the education and formation of our young people. Catholic schools, parochial religious education, and youth ministry are all important means of evangelization and catechesis.</li>
      <li><i>A personal synthesis for practical use</i>: Another way of viewing pastoral formation is to see it as a process linking the elements of human, spiritual, and intellectual formation in such a way that they can be put to practical use for others, especially in a parish context.<span class="footnumber">445</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 58.</span> In a parish internship experience, for example, the seminarian draws on the experience before him in the parish and asks how his human, spiritual, and intellectual formation makes a difference. With due attention to the discipline of the Church, preaching might be one instance of a theoretical, personal, and practical synthesis. Other examples include evangelization, catechesis, and participation in the Church’s social justice ministry. In these and other ways, he revisits his formation and views it through the lens of practice, application, and impact.<span class="footnumber">446</span><span class="footnote">The goal is “to help the seminarian to acquire the inner freedom to live the apostolate as service, able to see the work of God in the hearts and lives of the people.” <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 119.</span></li>
      <li><i>An initiation to various practical, pastoral experiences, especially in parishes</i>: It is important not to sacrifice human, spiritual, and intellectual formation for practical experience. Still, it is essential to cultivate pastoral formation and to enhance and integrate the other dimensions of formation so that the seminarian has opportunities to experience pastoral life firsthand.<span class="footnumber">447</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 58; CCEO, c. 353.</span><br>Seminaries must initiate seminarians into pastoral experiences and pastoral reflection in a variety of ways including concurrent field placements and internships. In the vocational synthesis stage, reflection with the pastoral team at his assignment and with his formators will help the newly ordained deacon to synthesize and strengthen the integration of all he has experienced in formation.<br>Whatever the setting, it is necessary that it facilitates learning. It is also necessary that there be a guide, mentor, or teacher who accompanies the seminarian and helps him to learn from the experience. In addition, there must be a skilled priest supervisor who helps the seminarian enter into the specifically priestly dimension of the ministry.<span class="footnumber">448</span><span class="footnote">See CIC, c. 258.</span><br>In these experiences, the seminarian first enters the scene as an observer, then raises questions to understand what is happening, and finally relates it to his other formation. He should then practice or try to do what the situation requires. After that, he can profit from supervision that helps him to assess what happened and gives him feedback.<br>A process of theological reflection follows that identifies the faith assumptions and convictions underlying both the situation and the ministerial response. Theological reflection thus provides an opportunity for personal synthesis, the clarification of motivations, and the development of directions for life and ministry.<br>And the final step, of course, is in fact to return to the ministry or pastoral situation, but now with more knowledge and ability and a better inner sense of direction because of an enriched spiritual life and a more deeply grounded sense of priestly identity. It is the responsibility of the diocesan bishop, the major superior, and the rectors to ensure that the Catholic, sacramental dimension of pastoral care is integral to all such programs in which seminarians participate.</li>
      <li><i>Cultural sensitivity</i>: Pastoral formation must flow from and move toward an appreciation of the multifaceted reality of the Church.<span class="footnumber">449</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 59.</span> In the United States, this means a genuine appreciation of the diversity that marks the Catholic Church as well as the diversity that typifies this society generally. Seminarians need exposure to the many cultures and languages that belong to the Catholic Church in the United States. They should know how to welcome migrants and refugees pastorally, liturgically, and culturally. Simultaneously, they should assist newcomers to adapt themselves into the mainstream without losing their own identity. <span class="footnumber">450</span><span class="footnote">See Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant People, Erga Migrantes (Instruction on the Love of Christ Towards Migrants, 2004). The propaedeutic stage section lists resources for formation in cultural sensitivity and intercultural competency.</span> Seminaries that serve ecclesiastical entities that have a constant flux of immigrants should ensure that seminarians take courses and receive pastoral experience that can help them to hone applicable ministerial skills to serve immigrants.</li>
      <li><i>Religious pluralism</i>: Seminarians also need to know, appreciate, and learn how to work within the ecumenical and interfaith context that forms a backdrop for life in the United States and for the Catholic Church in this nation.</li>
      <li><i>The poor</i>: If seminarians are to be formed after the model of Jesus, the Good Shepherd, who came “to bring glad tidings to the poor,” then they must have sustained contact with those who are privileged in God’s eyes—the poor, the marginalized, the sick, and the suffering. In the course of these encounters, they learn to cultivate a preferential option for the poor. They also need to become aware of the social contexts and structures that can breed injustice as well as ways of promoting more just contexts and structures.</li>
      <li><i>Ministry to all walks of life</i>: As much as possible, pastoral assignments are to give seminarians experience with all age groups in the Church; it is important they are taught to bring the mercy and love of God to everyone. In particular, the sick, the elderly, the disabled, those who live in isolation (such as migrants), and prisoners deserve particular attention.<span class="footnumber">451</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 124.</span> The social sciences serve pastoral theology by assisting future priests in grasping the context of ministry in all walks of life.</li>
      <li><i>Leadership development</i>: Pastoral formation means that seminarians learn how to take spiritual initiatives and direct a community into action or movement. That leadership also includes a dimension of practical administration. The pastoral formation program should provide opportunities for seminarians to acquire the basic administrative skills necessary for effective pastoral leadership, recognizing that programs of continuing education and ongoing formation will be necessary to equip newly ordained priests to assume future responsibilities as pastors.<br>Additional leadership skills include an ability to manage the physical and financial resources of the parish, including educating parishioners about the Gospel value of stewardship, supervising staff and volunteers, making effective use of pastoral and finance councils, and organizing parochial life effectively to achieve the goals of evangelization. It is important to recognize that lay persons, especially those working at diocesan offices, bring an essential expertise. Further, the experience of seasoned pastors is invaluable, as is the development of working relationships between future priests and diocesan officials.</li>
      <li><i>Professional standards</i>: Every seminarian must become capable of practicing and promoting the professional standards of ministerial behavior that are expected of all Church employees and volunteers, including ministerial codes of conduct and policies regarding conflict of interest, financial transparency, appropriate boundaries, and the use of social media.</li>
      <li><i>The cultivation of personal qualities</i>: In the current situation in the United States, parish life is blessed with many people who serve: permanent deacons, consecrated men and women, professional lay ministers, volunteers, and members of parish and diocesan consultative bodies. To direct others and to work well with them, priests need a number of personal qualities. A seminarian who aspires to serve as a priest needs to cultivate these qualities in the process of pastoral formation. They include a sense of responsibility for initiating and completing tasks, time management abilities, a spirit of collaboration with others, an ability to facilitate resolution of conflicts, a flexibility of spirit that can make adjustments for new and unexpected circumstances, an availability to those who serve and those who are served, and finally zeal—or the ardent desire to bring all people closer to the Lord.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="371">§371 </span>Pastoral formation depends in great measure on the quality of supervision. To serve as a supervisor of seminarians calls for experience, competence, and generosity. Priests and others who serve as supervisors, mentors, and professors are an extension of the seminary. It is important that this identification with priestly formation become part of the mindset of pastoral staffs who serve to initiate seminarians to pastoral life. When onsite pastoral formation is seen as an integral part of priestly formation, then pastoral staffs must accept a special responsibility in the name of the Church for the direction and help they provide to seminarians. These priests and those associated with them must have certain qualities that include loyal commitment to priestly formation, patience, honesty, an almost instinctive way of thinking theologically in pastoral situations, and a habit of prayer that permeates their ministry.</p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="372">§372 </span>Clearly, pastoral formation not only connects with the other three dimensions of priestly formation but, in itself, provides a goal that integrates the other dimensions. Human formation enables priests to be bridges to communicate Jesus Christ, a pastoral function. Spiritual formation enables priests to persevere in and give depth to their ministry. Intellectual formation provides criteria and content to ensure that pastoral efforts are directed correctly, properly, and effectively.</p>

Benchmarks in the pastoral dimension include an awareness of the pastoral situation of the local community or ecclesiastical entity, as well as an awareness of the multicultural reality of the Church in the United States and the nature of the Universal Church. Priests serving in the United States, regardless of their cultural background, often serve in a multicultural setting. Working toward cultural competency, including language competency, to meet pastoral needs in his diocese should be part of the formation a seminarian receives during the propaedeutic stage, so as to lay a solid foundation for continued formation in cultural competency in later stages.<span class="footnumber">453</span><span class="footnote">Useful resources for formation in cultural competency include USCCB Committee on Cultural Diversity in the Church, Open Wide Our Hearts: The Enduring Call to Love—A Pastoral Letter Against Racism (Washington, DC: USCCB, 2018); USCCB Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Island Affairs, under the direction of the USCCB Committee on Cultural Diversity in the Church, Encountering Christ in Harmony: A Pastoral Response to Our Asian and Pacific Island Brothers and Sisters (Washington, DC: USCCB, 2018); USCCB Committee on Cultural Diversity in the Church, Building Intercultural Competence for Ministers (Washington, DC: USCCB, 2014); USCCB Committee on Cultural Diversity in the Church, Best Practices for Shared Parishes: So That They May All Be One (Washington, DC: USCCB, 2013).</span> Pastoral charity is at the heart of the Church and the priesthood; so demonstrating a genuine concern for others, a spirit of generosity, and a developing habit of self-donation are also necessary benchmarks to be achieved prior to the seminarian’s acceptance into the discipleship stage.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="374">§374 </span>“As the Second Vatican Council reminds us, the nature and mission of priests must be understood within the Church, the People of God, the Body of Christ, the Temple of the Holy Spirit, for the service of which they consecrate their lives.”<span class="footnumber">454</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 30.</span> The foundation in pastoral knowledge, pastoral skills, and pastoral charity, which is laid during the discipleship stage, will enable the seminarian in the following stages to continue to develop the skills necessary for a life of service in the Church. Pastoral knowledge acquired in the discipleship stage includes competency in the performance of liturgical roles in the seminary community as well as knowledge gained by actively participating in formation seminars. Pastoral skills adequately demonstrated by the end of the discipleship stage include relating well with others, both in the seminary and in pastoral settings; freedom from prejudices against any class or group of individuals; a willingness to work with people of diverse cultural backgrounds; demonstrated generosity to the poor given his limited means; demonstrated accompaniment of the poor; the ability to tithe; and a willingness and ability to work collaboratively as a member of a team. It is necessary that seminarians demonstrate that they relate well to women in authority and in peer situations. Seminarians demonstrate good stewardship of personal and communal property. They demonstrate the capacity to take initiative in leadership situations and express a missionary spirit with a zeal for evangelization.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="375">§375 </span>Pastoral knowledge and pastoral skills are meaningless if they are not accompanied by pastoral charity. To aid in the development of pastoral charity, it is necessary for the seminarian to demonstrate by the end of the discipleship stage a commitment to apostolic works of Christian charity and an awareness of issues surrounding global poverty.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="376">§376 </span>Pastoral opportunities in the seminary and in pastoral ministry allow the seminarian, with the trusting guidance of his formators, to recognize and hone his pastoral leadership skills. As a servant leader he is called constantly to look to Jesus as his model. “Jesus, the Son of God, has assumed the condition of a slave even unto death (cf. Phil 2:6-8). Before dying on the cross, he washed the feet of his disciples, commanding them to do the same (cf. Jn 13:1-17).”<span class="footnumber">455</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 38.</span> As a human instrument of Jesus, he can demonstrate that he is articulate, good at listening, and capable of public speaking. He can take on the role of a public person in the Church.

      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="377">§377 </span>In his pastoral assignments, the seminarian demonstrates availability to commit his life to priestly ministry, growing to demonstrate the same compassion, generosity, understanding, love for all (especially the poor), and zeal for the Kingdom that characterized the ministry of the Son of God. “This can be summed up as pastoral charity.”<span class="footnumber">456</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 119.</span> The seminarian demonstrates pastoral charity in his sensitivity and prudence with behavior and language in pastoral settings. He demonstrates multicultural sensitivity and openness to people of all ages, religious backgrounds, and social status in speech and action. He demonstrates the ability to collaborate with both men and women. He demonstrates the capacity to abide prudently by safe environment guidelines and to maintain proper boundaries in all relationships, especially with minors and other vulnerable individuals. If a seminarian violates appropriate boundaries with adults or minors, including the sexual abuse of a minor, immediate action must be taken in accordance with diocesan or eparchial policies, the <i>Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People</i>, and Canon and civil law.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="378">§378 </span>By the end of the configuration stage the seminarian can organize a homily around a central point. He can reflect theologically on pastoral issues. He learns that offering his life in service to the Church involves understanding and following the will of Christ in the person of his diocesan bishop or the competent authority of an institute of consecrated life or society of apostolic life. The seminarian’s continued growth in confidence allows him to discern and continue to discover how God will use his unique talents in ordained ministry. Given that he will be entrusted with the temporal goods of the Church, he also demonstrates the ability to manage his own personal finances. He also remains free from unnecessary debt.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="379">§379 </span>As in the other stages, during this stage the pastoral dimension of formation can be presented in terms of pastoral knowledge, pastoral skills, pastoral discernment, and pastoral charity. Regarding pastoral knowledge, the deacon demonstrates “a capacity for critical observation” so that he “can discern true and false values, since this is an essential requirement of establishing a constructive dialogue with the world of today.”<span class="footnumber">457</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ecclesia in America</i>, no. 40.</span> It is essential that he demonstrates the ability to celebrate the sacraments and liturgies of the Church validly, licitly, and confidently, and that he also develops a knowledge about and understanding of the role of various movements and apostolates that are so essential to the pastoral life of the Church. He understands and knows how to encourage and support consecrated life. He sees the importance of various ecclesial movements in the evangelistic life of the Church. He understands the centrality of the apostolate of Catholic education. He is open to the various unique and beautiful ways the Holy Spirit is working to bring about a new evangelization in our time.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="380">§380 </span>The pastoral skills he demonstrates prior to ordination to priesthood include the ability to craft and successfully deliver homilies,<span class="footnumber">458</span><span class="footnote">“The homily is the touchstone for judging a pastor’s closeness and ability to communicate to his people.

It is sad that this is the case. The homily can actually be an intense and happy experience of the Spirit, a consoling encounter with God’s word, a constant source of renewal and growth.” Evangelii Gaudium, no. 135.

      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="381">§381 </span>Central to the vocational synthesis stage is learning the prudence of discernment. This discernment is twofold, both personal and pastoral. <span class="footnumber">460</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, nos. 43, 120.</span> Having first experienced how God leads him interiorly as he has sought his own conversion and grown in a life of prayer, the transitional deacon must now learn how God will lead him in his pastoral ministry, learning “to listen to the conscience that judges his movements and the interior urges that motivate his actions. In this way, the priest learns to govern himself using the spiritual and mental powers of mind and body. He grasps the sense of what can be done and what it would be better not to do, or what should not be done.”<span class="footnumber">461</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 43.</span> Ultimately, he learns to coordinate the many obligations of his office by growing in union with Christ’s pastoral charity.<span class="footnumber">462</span><span class="footnote">“Priests who are perplexed and distracted by the very many obligations of their position may be anxiously enquiring how they can reduce to unity their interior life and their program of external activity. This unity of life cannot be brought about by merely an outward arrangement of the works of the ministry nor by the practice of spiritual exercises alone, though this may help to foster such unity. Priests can however achieve it by following in the fulfillment of their ministry the example of Christ the Lord, whose meat was to do the will of him who sent him that he might perfect his work.” <i>Presbyterorum Ordinis</i>, no. 14.</span></p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="382">§382 </span>This personal discernment moves to pastoral discernment, through which the future priest learns to “listen deeply to real situations and [is] capable of good judgment in making choices and decisions.” An “evangelical style of listening. . . . frees the pastor from the temptation to abstraction, to self-promotion, to excessive self-assurance, and to that aloofness, that would make him a ‘spiritual accountant’ instead of a ‘good Samaritan.’”<span class="footnumber">463</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 120.</span> This discernment is especially important today because of the complexity of situations in which people come needing the help of the Church. “The gaze of the Good Shepherd, who seeks out, walks alongside and leads his sheep, will form a serene, prudent and compassionate outlook in him. He will exercise his ministry with a disposition of serene openness and attentive accompaniment in all situations, even those that are most complex, showing the beauty and the demands of Gospel truth, without falling into legalistic or rigorist obsessions.”<span class="footnumber">464</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 120.</span></p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="383">§383 </span>Finally, pastoral formation must lead the transitional deacon to the desire to make a gift of his life for his people in pastoral charity, in imitation of Christ, the Good Shepherd. This will lead to an ability to convey the teachings of the Church in pastoral settings (e.g., teaching, preaching, and pastoral counseling) with charity and zeal at all times and to embrace a preferential option for the poor in pastoral settings. This desire will strengthen him, over the years of priestly ministry, to make a generous gift of himself without counting the cost.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="384">§384 </span>This stage, which leads to the transitional deacon’s public expression of his free, conscious, and definitive intention for the priesthood, must also encourage him to find a suitable time for his spiritual preparation to priestly ordination<span class="footnumber">465</span><span class="footnote">See <i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 77.</span> and to show his positive disposition for ongoing formation with his future brother priests after ordination.</p>

      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="386">§386 </span>The pastoral formation program should be an integral part of the seminary curriculum.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="387">§387 </span>The goals and objectives of the pastoral formation program must be clearly stated and must serve as the basis for the evaluation of seminarians in this area. This statement should also include a description of professional ministerial ethics.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="388">§388 </span>The coordinator of pastoral formation must be a priest, possess the requisite parochial experience and professional expertise, and participate in professional organizations in the area of seminary pastoral formation. The coordinator must model a love for priestly ministry in the Church.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="389">§389 </span>The pastoral formation program should provide seminarians with a broad exposure to supervised pastoral service, with primary emphasis on parish ministry.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="390">§390 </span>Determinations about the concurrent or intensive residency (onsite) program should be made by the seminary in collaboration with the ecclesiastical entity it serves. Seminaries and ecclesiastical entities that make provision for onsite experiences are also responsible for ensuring that these experiences help seminarians develop skills and attitudes that will enhance their future priestly ministry and that when ecumenical in nature—for example, clinical pastoral education (CPE)—these experiences are respectful of Catholic teaching, especially on moral or ethical issues. It is the responsibility of the competent authority to ensure that the Catholic, sacramental dimension of pastoral care is integral to all such programs in which seminarians participate.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="391">§391 </span>Supervision, theological reflection, and evaluation are necessary components of an effective pastoral program. Although theological reflection can help the development of pastoral skills, its primary purpose is to interpret pastoral experience or activity in light of Sacred Scripture, Church teaching, personal faith, and pastoral practices. Reflection of this kind should become a lifelong habit in priestly ministry.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="392">§392 </span>Onsite supervisors should be carefully selected with an eye to their dedication to the Church and respect for the priesthood. They should be taught the skills of pastoral supervision and evaluation.

      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="393">§393 </span>In addition to onsite supervisors, others collaborating in the various ministries, as well as those served, should be asked to participate in the evaluation of seminarians in ministry.</p>

      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="396">§396 </span>However the pastoral formation program is organized, it must pay attention to the seminarians’ need to root a life of service in personal prayer. Seminarians need supervision in developing the habit of prayer in the context of pastoral activity and in learning to establish a rhythm of life that provides an appropriate balance of prayer, service, study, exercise, and leisure. Priest supervisors and mentors should be chosen who model this balance in their own life and ministry. Evaluation of seminarians in ministerial placements should include observations leading to a growing accountability in these areas.</p>
      <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="397">§397 </span>The seminary should keep before its diocesan seminarians the prospect of their future incardination into a particular diocese and its presbyterate.

  <button type="button" class="collapsible title1">THE ONGOING FORMATION OF PRIESTS</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="399">§399 </span>The stages of priestly formation can appropriately be viewed as an initiation to sacramental life, not unlike the process envisioned in the Order of Christian Initiation for Adults. Just as the catechumen is introduced into a lifetime relationship of missionary discipleship with Jesus Christ, so too—for the one who is being formed for a lifetime of priestly service in the Church—“the term ‘ongoing formation’ is a reminder that the one experience of discipleship of those called to priesthood is never interrupted.”<span class="footnumber">468</span><span class="footnote"><i>Ratio Fundamentalis</i>, no. 80.</span> Sacramental preparation and initiation necessarily includes a period of postsacramental catechesis or mystagogia. Once celebrated, the sacraments are meant to be lived out, to be integrated into all dimensions of one’s life, and to be a source of continuing transformation. For those who prepare for priestly ordination and for those who serve the formational process, this pattern of sacramental initiation implies the analogous necessity of helping seminarians commit themselves wholeheartedly to ongoing formation after ordination. The process and journey of the ongoing formation of priests are both necessary and lifelong. Their purpose is not only the spiritual growth of the priest himself but also the continued effectiveness of his mission and ministry. Only by continually conforming their interior lives and their ministry to the life of Jesus are priests able to live a lifetime of healthy discipleship. This cannot be done unless priests, through prayer, continue to penetrate more deeply into the mystery of Christ.<span class="footnumber">469</span><span class="footnote">“Pastoral charity demands that priests, if they are not to run in vain, should always work within the bond of union with the bishops and their fellow priests. If they act in this manner, priests will find unity of life in the unity of the Church’s own mission. In this way they will be united with their Lord and through him with the Father in the Holy Spirit, and can be filled with consolation and exceedingly abound with joy.” <i>Presbyterorum Ordinis</i>, no. 14.</span></p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="400">§400 </span>The basic principle of ongoing formation for priests is contained in <i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>: “one can speak of a vocation ‘within’ the priesthood. The fact is that God continues to call and send forth, revealing his saving plan in the historical development of the priest’s life and the life of the Church and of society. It is in this perspective that the meaning of ongoing formation emerges. Permanent formation is necessary in order to discern and follow this constant call or will of God” within the context of the universal call to holiness of all disciples of Jesus Christ.<span class="footnumber">470</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 70.</span></p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="401">§401 </span>The configuration stage and the vocational synthesis stage should lay the foundations for the ongoing formation of priests across a lifetime of ministry. This is done in several ways:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>The seminary formation program must be imbued with a vision of life after ordination. “It is particularly important to be aware of and to respect the intrinsic link between formation before ordination to the priesthood and formation after ordination.”<span class="footnumber">471</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 70.</span></li>
      <li>Planning for ongoing formation, and learning how to plan, begins in the seminary. “Long-term preparation for ongoing formation should take place in the major seminary, where encouragement needs to be given to future priests to look forward to it, seeing its necessity, its advantages and the spirit in which it should be undertaken, and appropriate conditions for its realization need to be ensured.”<span class="footnumber">472</span><span class="footnote"><i>Pastores Dabo Vobis</i>, no. 70.</span></li>
      <li>It is important that the seminary emphasize to seminarians that ongoing formation is a regular and necessary aspect of the life of priestly ministry. This conviction, imparted to the seminarians and to ecclesiastical entities alike, will encourage them to engage in the process of ongoing formation in all its dimensions—human, spiritual, intellectual, and pastoral.</li>
      <li>The seminary must be vigilant that programs lead to future habits of study, prayer, and formational involvement.</li>
      <li>On occasion, the seminary may provide personnel and resources for transition programs into priesthood. Or it may invite newly ordained and more mature priests back to reflect on their experience of transition and to engage in mystagogical catechesis that focuses on the Rite of Ordination and subsequent experiences of ministry. The seminary could serve as a fraternal meeting point for ongoing formation.</li>
      <li>The seminary may assist the transitional deacon to develop a plan of ongoing formation for his first years of priestly ministry.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="402">§402 </span>In the United States, the seminary—in its various formational efforts—ought to lead seminarians to the vision and practice of ongoing formation contained in Canon Law<span class="footnumber">473</span><span class="footnote">CIC, c. 279; CCEO, c. 372.</span> and in the USCCB document The Basic Plan for the Ongoing Formation of Priests, which is the standard for those who are ordained priests.

          <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="471">§471 </span>All professors must be dedicated to the total formation of the seminarians. Professors teach first by the quality of their lives.

          <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="473">§473 </span>Every professor influences seminarians’ growth in priestly maturity.

          <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="478">§478</span>Because of the importance of a pastoral orientation in seminary programs, some involvement by professors in parish ministry or in other apostolic activities complements their work in the seminary.

  <div class="content">
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="489">§489 </span>The Catholic Church in the United States is deeply grateful to those dedicated to the noble enterprise of priestly formation, mindful of its cherished heritage of seminary life. Likewise, the bishops of the Church in the United States are confident that this essential task will continue in a more effective way in the ongoing years of the third Christian millennium and are firmly committed to this mission. It is their hope that this sixth edition of the <i>Program of Priestly Formation</i> will serve this goal. Christ the Good Shepherd still calls men to follow him, to “put out into deep water” (Lk 5:4), and to respond to his invitation to become a priest after his own heart, eager to be transformed through human, spiritual, intellectual, and pastoral formation.</p>
    <p><span class="sectionnumber" id="490">§490 </span>May the Lord who has begun this good work among us bring it to completion.<span class="footnumber">532</span><span class="footnote">See Phil 1:6. See also <i>Ordination of a Bishop, of Priests, and of Deacons</i>, no. 125.</span></p>
