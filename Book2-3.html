  <h3 id="SECTION_I:">SECTION I: INSTITUTES OF CONSECRATED LIFE</h3>
  <h4 id="TITLE_I.">TITLE I: NORMS COMMON TO ALL INSTITUTES OF CONSECRATED LIFE (Cann. 573 - 606)</h4>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 573<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The life consecrated through the profession of the evangelical counsels is a stable form of living by which the faithful, following Christ more closely under the action of the Holy Spirit, are totally dedicated to God who is loved most of all, so that, having been dedicated by a new and special title to His honor, to the building up of the Church, and to the salvation of the world, they strive for the perfection of charity in the service of the kingdom of God and, having been made an outstanding sign in the Church, foretell the heavenly glory.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The Christian faithful freely assume this form of living in institutes of consecrated life canonically erected by competent authority of the Church. Through vows or other sacred bonds according to the proper laws of the institutes, they profess the evangelical counsels of chastity, poverty, and obedience and, through the charity to which the counsels lead, are joined in a special way to the Church and its mystery.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 574<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The state of those who profess the evangelical counsels in institutes of this type belongs to the life and holiness of the Church and must be fostered and promoted by all in the Church.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Certain Christian faithful are specially called by God to this state so that they possess a special gift in the life of the Church and contribute to its salvific mission, according to the purpose and spirit of the institute.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 575 The evangelical counsels, based on the teaching and examples of Christ the Teacher, are a divine gift which the Church has received from the Lord and preserves always through His grace.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 576 It is for the competent authority of the Church to interpret the evangelical counsels, to direct their practice by laws, and by canonical approbation to establish the stable forms of living deriving from them, and also, for its part, to take care that the institutes grow and flourish according to the spirit of the founders and sound traditions.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 577 In the Church there are a great many institutes of consecrated life which have different gifts according to the grace which has been given them: they more closely follow Christ who prays, or announces the kingdom of God, or does good to people, or lives with people in the world, yet who always does the will of the Father.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 578 All must observe faithfully the mind and designs of the founders regarding the nature, purpose, spirit, and character of an institute, which have been sanctioned by competent ecclesiastical authority, and its sound traditions, all of which constitute the patrimony of the same institute.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 579 Diocesan bishops, each in his own territory, can erect institutes of consecrated life by formal decree, provided that the Apostolic See has been consulted.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 580 The aggregation of one institute of consecrated life to another is reserved to the competent authority of the aggregating institute; the canonical autonomy of the aggregated institute is always to be preserved.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 581 To divide an institute into parts, by whatever name they are called, to erect new parts, to join those erected, or to redefine their boundaries belongs to the competent authority of the institute, according to the norm of the constitutions.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 582 Mergers and unions of institutes of consecrated life are reserved to the Apostolic See only; confederations and federations are also reserved to it.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 583 Changes in institutes of consecrated life affecting those things which had been approved by the Apostolic See cannot be made without its permission.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 584 The suppression of an institute pertains only to the Apostolic See; a decision regarding the temporal goods of the institute is also reserved to the Apostolic See.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 585 It belongs to the competent authority of an institute to suppress its parts.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 586<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A just autonomy of life, especially of governance, is acknowledged for individual institutes, by which they possess their own discipline in the Church and are able to preserve their own patrimony intact, as mentioned in can. 578.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. It is for local ordinaries to preserve and safeguard this autonomy.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 587<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. To protect more faithfully the proper vocation and identity of each institute, the fundamental code or constitutions of every institute must contain, besides those things which are to be observed as stated in can. 578, fundamental norms regarding governance of the institute, the discipline of members, incorporation and formation of members, and the proper object of the sacred bonds.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. A code of this type is approved by competent authority of the Church and can be changed only with its consent.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. In this code spiritual and juridic elements are to be joined together suitably; nevertheless, norms are not to be multiplied without necessity.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>4. Other norms established by competent authority of an institute are to be collected suitably in other codes and, moreover, can be reviewed appropriately and adapted according to the needs of places and times.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 588<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. By its very nature, the state of consecrated life is neither clerical nor lay.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. That institute is called clerical which, by reason of the purpose or design intended by the founder or by virtue of legitimate tradition, is under the direction of clerics, assumes the exercise of sacred orders, and is recognized as such by the authority of the Church.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. That institute is called lay which, recognized as such by the authority of the Church, has by virtue of its nature, character, and purpose a proper function defined by the founder or by legitimate tradition, which does not include the exercise of sacred orders.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 589 An institute of consecrated life is said to be of pontifical right if the Apostolic See has erected it or approved it through a formal decree. It is said to be of diocesan right, however, if it has been erected by a diocesan bishop but has not obtained a decree of approval from the Apostolic See.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 590<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Inasmuch as institutes of consecrated life are dedicated in a special way to the service of God and of the whole Church, they are subject to the supreme authority of the Church in a special way.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Individual members are also bound to obey the Supreme Pontiff as their highest superior by reason of the sacred bond of obedience.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 591 In order to provide better for the good of institutes and the needs of the apostolate, the Supreme Pontiff, by reason of his primacy in the universal Church and with a view to common advantage, can exempt institutes of consecrated life from the governance of local ordinaries and subject them to himself alone or to another ecclesiastical authority.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 592<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. In order better to foster the communion of institutes with the Apostolic See, each supreme moderator is to send a brief report of the state and life of the institute to the Apostolic See, in a manner and at a time established by the latter.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The moderators of every institute are to promote knowledge of documents of the Holy See which regard the members entrusted to them and are to take care about their observance.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 593 Without prejudice to the prescript of&nbsp;<b>⇒</b>&nbsp;can. 586, institutes of pontifical right are immediately and exclusively subject to the power of the Apostolic See in regards to internal governance and discipline.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 594 Without prejudice to can. 586, an institute of diocesan right remains under the special care of the diocesan bishop.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 595<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. It is for the bishop of the principal seat to approve the constitutions and confirm changes legitimately introduced into them, without prejudice to those things which the Apostolic See has taken in hand, and also to treat affairs of greater importance affecting the whole institute which exceed the power of internal authority, after he has consulted the other diocesan bishops, however, if the institute has spread to several dioceses.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. A diocesan bishop can grant dispensations from the constitutions in particular cases.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 596<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Superiors and chapters of institutes possess that power over members which is defined in universal law and the constitutions.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. In clerical religious institutes of pontifical right, however, they also possess ecclesiastical power of governance for both the external and internal forum.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. The prescripts of cann. 131, 133, and 137- 144 apply to the power mentioned in §1.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 597<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Any Catholic endowed with a right intention who has the qualities required by universal and proper law and who is not prevented by any impediment can be admitted into an institute of consecrated life.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. No one can be admitted without suitable preparation.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 598<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Each institute, attentive to its own character and purposes, is to define in its constitutions the manner in which the evangelical counsels of chastity, poverty, and obedience must be observed for its way of living.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Moreover, all members must not only observe the evangelical counsels faithfully and fully but also arrange their life according to the proper law of the institute and thereby strive for the perfection of their state.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 599 The evangelical counsel of chastity assumed for the sake of the kingdom of heaven, which is a sign of the world to come and a source of more abundant fruitfulness in an undivided heart, entails the obligation of perfect continence in celibacy.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 600 The evangelical counsel of poverty in imitation of Christ who, although he was rich, was made poor for us, entails, besides a life which is poor in fact and in spirit and is to be led productively in moderation and foreign to earthly riches, a dependence and limitation in the use and disposition of goods according to the norm of the proper law of each institute.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 601 The evangelical counsel of obedience, undertaken in a spirit of faith and love in the following of Christ obedient unto death, requires the submission of the will to legitimate superiors, who stand in the place of God, when they command according to the proper constitutions.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 602 The life of brothers or sisters proper to each institute, by which all the members are united together as a special family in Christ, is to be defined in such a way that it becomes a mutual support for all in fulfilling the vocation of each. Moreover, by their communion as brothers or sisters rooted and founded in charity, members are to be an example of universal reconciliation in Christ.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 603<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. In addition to institutes of consecrated life, the Church recognizes the eremitic or anchoritic life by which the Christian faithful devote their life to the praise of God and the salvation of the world through a stricter withdrawal from the world, the silence of solitude, and assiduous prayer and penance.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. A hermit is recognized by law as one dedicated to God in consecrated life if he or she publicly professes in the hands of the diocesan bishop the three evangelical counsels, confirmed by vow or other sacred bond, and observes a proper program of living under his direction.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 604<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Similar to these forms of consecrated life is the order of virgins who, expressing the holy resolution of following Christ more closely, are consecrated to God by the diocesan bishop according to the approved liturgical rite, are mystically betrothed to Christ, the Son of God, and are dedicated to the service of the Church.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. In order to observe their own resolution more faithfully and to perform by mutual assistance service to the Church in harmony with their proper state, virgins can be associated together.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 605 The approval of new forms of consecrated life is reserved only to the Apostolic See. Diocesan bishops, however, are to strive to discern new gifts of consecrated life granted to the Church by the Holy Spirit and are to assist promoters so that these can express their proposals as well as possible and protect them by appropriate statutes; the general norms contained in this section are especially to be utilized.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 606 Those things which are established for institutes of consecrated life and their members are equally valid in law for either sex, unless it is otherwise evident from the context of the wording or the nature of the matter.&nbsp;</p>

  <h4 id="TITLE_II.">TITLE II. RELIGIOUS INSTITUTES (Cann. 607 - 709)</h4>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 607<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. As a consecration of the whole person, religious life manifests in the Church a wonderful marriage brought about by God, a sign of the future age. Thus the religious brings to perfection a total self-giving as a sacrifice offered to God, through which his or her whole existence becomes a continuous worship of God in charity.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. A religious institute is a society in which members, according to proper law, pronounce public vows, either perpetual or temporary which are to be renewed, however, when the period of time has elapsed, and lead a life of brothers or sisters in common.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. The public witness to be rendered by religious to Christ and the Church entails a separation from the world proper to the character and purpose of each institute.</p>
  <h5 id="CHAPTER_I.">CHAPTER I. RELIGIOUS HOUSES AND THEIR ERECTION AND SUPPRESSION</h5>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 608 A religious community must live in a legitimately established house under the authority of a superior designated according to the norm of law. Each house is to have at least an oratory in which the Eucharist is to be celebrated and reserved so that it is truly the center of the community.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 609<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Houses of a religious institute are erected by the authority competent according to the constitutions, with the previous written consent of the diocesan bishop.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. In addition, the permission of the Apostolic See is required to erect a monastery of nuns.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 610<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The erection of houses takes place with consideration for their advantage to the Church and the institute and with suitable safeguards for those things which are required to carry out properly the religious life of the members according to the proper purposes and spirit of the institute.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. No house is to be erected unless it can be judged prudently that the needs of the members will be provided for suitably.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 611 The consent of the diocesan bishop to erect a religious house of any institute entails the right:</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">1/</span> to lead a life according to the character and proper purposes of the institute;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">2/</span> to exercise the works proper to the institute according to the norm of law and without prejudice to the conditions attached to the consent;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">3/</span> for clerical institutes to have a church, without prejudice to the prescript of can. 1215, §3 and to perform sacred ministries, after the requirements of the law have been observed.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 612 For a religious house to be converted to apostolic works different from those for which it was established, the consent of the diocesan bishop is required, but not if it concerns a change which refers only to internal governance and discipline, without prejudice to the laws of the foundation.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 613<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A religious house of canons regular or of monks under the governance and care of its own moderator is autonomous unless the constitutions state otherwise.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The moderator of an autonomous house is a major superior by law.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 614 Monasteries of nuns associated to an institute of men maintain their own way of life and governance according to the constitutions. Mutual rights and obligations are to be defined in such a way that spiritual good can come from the association.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 615 An autonomous monastery which does not have another major superior besides its own moderator and is not associated to another institute of religious in such a way that the superior of the latter possesses true power over such a monastery as determined by the constitutions is entrusted to the special vigilance of the diocesan bishop according to the norm of law.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 616<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The supreme moderator can suppress a legitimately erected religious house according to the norm of the constitutions, after the diocesan bishop has been consulted. The proper law of the institute is to make provision for the goods of the suppressed house, without prejudice to the intentions of the founders or donors or to legitimately acquired rights.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The suppression of the only house of an institute belongs to the Holy See, to which the decision regarding the goods in that case is also reserved.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. To suppress the autonomous house mentioned in can. 613 belongs to the general chapter, unless the constitutions state otherwise.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>4. To suppress an autonomous monastery of nuns belongs to the Apostolic See, with due regard to the prescripts of the constitutions concerning its goods.</p>
  <h5 id="CHAPTER_II.">CHAPTER II. THE GOVERNANCE OF INSTITUTES</h5>
  <h6 id="Art._1.">Art. 1. SUPERIORS AND COUNCILS</h6>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 617 Superiors are to fulfill their function and exercise their power according to the norm of universal and proper law.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 618 Superiors are to exercise their power, received from God through the ministry of the Church, in a spirit of service. Therefore, docile to the will of God in fulfilling their function, they are to govern their subjects as sons or daughters of God and, promoting the voluntary obedience of their subjects with reverence for the human person, they are to listen to them willingly and foster their common endeavor for the good of the institute and the Church, but without prejudice to the authority of superiors to decide and prescribe what must be done.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 619 Superiors are to devote themselves diligently to their office and together with the members entrusted to them are to strive to build a community of brothers or sisters in Christ, in which God is sought and loved before all things. Therefore, they are to nourish the members regularly with the food of the word of God and are to draw them to the celebration of the sacred liturgy. They are to be an example to them in cultivating virtues and in the observance of the laws and traditions of their own institute; they are to meet the personal needs of the members appropriately, solicitously to care for and visit the sick, to correct the restless, to console the faint of heart, and to be patient toward all.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 620 Those who govern an entire institute, a province of an institute or part equivalent to a province, or an autonomous house, as well as their vicars, are major superiors. Comparable to these are an abbot primate and a superior of a monastic congregation, who nonetheless do not have all the power which universal law grants to major superiors.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 621 A grouping of several houses which constitutes an immediate part of the same institute under the same superior and has been canonically erected by legitimate authority is called a province.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 622 The supreme moderator holds power over all the provinces, houses, and members of an institute; this power is to be exercised according to proper law. Other superiors possess power within the limits of their function.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 623 In order for members to be appointed or elected validly to the function of superior, a suitable time is required after perpetual or definitive profession, to be determined by proper law, or if it concerns major superiors, by the constitutions.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 624<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Superiors are to be constituted for a certain and appropriate period of time according to the nature and need of the institute, unless the constitutions determine otherwise for the supreme moderator and for superiors of an autonomous house.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Proper law is to provide suitable norms so that superiors, constituted for a definite time, do not remain too long in offices of governance without interruption.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. Nevertheless, they can be removed from office during their function or be transferred to another for reasons established in proper law.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 625<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The supreme moderator of an institute is to be designated by canonical election according to the norm of the constitutions.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The bishop of the principal seat presides at the elections of a superior of the autonomous monastery mentioned in can. 615 and of the supreme moderator of an institute of diocesan right.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. Other superiors are to be constituted according to the norm of the constitutions, but in such a way that, if they are elected, they need the confirmation of a competent major superior; if they are appointed by a superior, however, a suitable consultation is to precede.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 626 Superiors in the conferral of offices and members in elections are to observe the norms of universal and proper law, are to abstain from any abuse or partiality, and are to appoint or elect those whom they know in the Lord to be truly worthy and suitable, having nothing before their eyes but God and the good of the institute. Moreover, in elections they are to avoid any procurement of votes, either directly or indirectly, whether for themselves or for others.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 627<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. According to the norm of the constitutions, superiors are to have their own council, whose assistance they must use in carrying out their function.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. In addition to the cases prescribed in universal law, proper law is to determine the cases which require consent or counsel to act validly; such consent or counsel must be obtained according to the norm of can. 127.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 628<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The superiors whom the proper law of the institute designates for this function are to visit the houses and members entrusted to them at stated times according to the norms of this same proper law.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. It is the right and duty of a diocesan bishop to visit even with respect to religious discipline:</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">1/</span> the autonomous monasteries mentioned in can. 615;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">2/</span> individual houses of an institute of diocesan right located in his own territory.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. Members are to act with trust toward a visitator, to whose legitimate questioning they are bound to respond according to the truth in charity. Moreover, it is not permitted for anyone in any way to divert members from this obligation or otherwise to impede the scope of the visitation.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 629 Superiors are to reside in their respective houses, and are not to absent themselves from their house except according to the norm of proper law.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 630<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Superiors are to recognize the due freedom of their members regarding the sacrament of penance and direction of conscience, without prejudice, however, to the discipline of the institute.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. According to the norm of proper law, superiors are to be concerned that suitable confessors are available to the members, to whom the members can confess frequently.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. In monasteries of nuns, in houses of formation, and in more numerous lay communities, there are to be ordinary confessors approved by the local ordinary after consultation with the community; nevertheless, there is no obligation to approach them.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>4. Superiors are not to hear the confessions of subjects unless the members request it on their own initiative.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>5. Members are to approach superiors with trust, to whom they can freely and on their own initiative open their minds. Superiors, however, are forbidden to induce the members in any way to make a manifestation of conscience to them.</p>
  <h6 id="Art._2.">Art. 2. CHAPTERS</h6>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 631<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The general chapter, which holds supreme authority in the institute according to the norm of the constitutions, is to be composed in such a way that, representing the entire institute, it becomes a true sign of its unity in charity. It is for the general chapter principally: to protect the patrimony of the institute mentioned in&nbsp;can. 578, promote suitable renewal according to that patrimony, elect the supreme moderator, treat affairs of greater importance, and issue norms which all are bound to obey.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The constitutions are to define the composition and extent of the power of a chapter; proper law is to determine further the order to be observed in the celebration of the chapter, especially in what pertains to elections and the manner of handling affairs.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. According to the norms determined in proper law, not only provinces and local communities, but also any member can freely send wishes and suggestions to a general chapter.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 632 Proper law is to determine accurately what is to pertain to other chapters of the institute and to other similar assemblies, namely, what pertains to their nature, authority, composition, way of proceeding and time of celebration.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 633<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Organs of participation or consultation are to fulfill faithfully the function entrusted to them according to the norm of universal and proper law and to express in their own way the concern and participation of all the members for the good of the entire institute or community.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. In establishing and using these means of participation and consultation, wise discretion is to be observed and their procedures are to conform to the character and purpose of the institute.</p>
  <h6 id="Art._3.">Art. 3. TEMPORAL GOODS AND THEIR ADMINISTRATION</h6>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 634<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. As juridic persons by the law itself, institutes, provinces, and houses are capable of acquiring, possessing, administering, and alienating temporal goods unless this capacity is excluded or restricted in the constitutions.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Nevertheless, they are to avoid any appearance of excess, immoderate wealth, and accumulation of goods.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 635<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Since the temporal goods of religious institutes are ecclesiastical, they are governed by the prescripts of Book V, The Temporal Goods of the Church, unless other provision is expressly made.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Nevertheless, each institute is to establish suitable norms concerning the use and administration of goods, by which the poverty proper to it is to be fostered, protected, and expressed.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 636<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. In each institute and likewise in each province which is governed by a major superior, there is to be a Finance officer, distinct from the major superior and constituted according to the norm of proper law, who is to manage the administration of goods under the direction of the respective superior. Insofar as possible, a Finance officer distinct from the local superior is to be designated even in local communities.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. At the time and in the manner established by proper law, Finance officers and other administrators are to render an account of their administration to the competent authority.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 637 The autonomous monasteries mentioned in can. 615 must render an account of their administration to the local ordinary once a year. Moreover, the local ordinary has the right to be informed about the Financial reports of a religious house of diocesan right.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 638<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Within the scope of universal law, it belongs to proper law to determine acts which exceed the limit and manner of ordinary administration and to establish what is necessary to place an act of extraordinary administration validly.</p>

Physical or psychic illness, even contracted after profession, which in the judgment of experts renders the member mentioned in §1 unsuited to lead the life of the institute constitutes a cause for not admitting the member to renew profession or to make perpetual profession, unless the illness had been contracted through the negligence of the institute or through work performed in the institute.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. If, however, a religious becomes insane during the period of temporary vows, even though unable to make a new profession, the religious cannot be dismissed from the institute.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 690<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The supreme moderator with the consent of the council can readmit without the burden of repeating the novitiate one who had legitimately left the institute after completing the novitiate or after profession. Moreover, it will be for the same moderator to determine an appropriate probation prior to temporary profession and the time of vows to precede perpetual profession, according to the norm of cann. 655 and 657.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The superior of an autonomous monastery with the consent of the council possesses the same faculty.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 691<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A perpetually professed religious is not to request an indult of departure from an institute except for the gravest of causes considered before the Lord. The religious is to present a petition to the supreme moderator of the institute who is to transmit it along with a personal opinion and the opinion of the council to the competent authority.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. In institutes of pontifical right, an indult of this type is reserved to the Apostolic See. In institutes of diocesan right, however, the bishop of the diocese in which the house of assignment is situated can also grant it.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 692 Unless it has been rejected by the member in the act of notification, an indult of departure granted legitimately and made known to the member entails by the law itself dispensation from the vows and from all the obligations arising from profession.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 693 If a member is a cleric, an indult is not granted before he finds a bishop who incardinates him in the diocese or at least receives him experimentally. If he is received experimentally, he is incardinated into the diocese by the law itself after five years have passed, unless the bishop has refused him.&nbsp;</p>
  <h6 id="DISMISSAL_OF_MEMBERS">Art. 3. DISMISSAL OF MEMBERS</h6>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 694<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A member must be held as ipso facto dismissed from an institute who:</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">1/</span> has defected notoriously from the Catholic faith;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">2/</span> has contracted marriage or attempted it, even only civilly.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. In these cases, after the proofs have been collected, the major superior with the council is to issue without any delay a declaration of fact so that the dismissal is established juridically.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 695<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A member must be dismissed for the delicts mentioned in cann. 1397, 1398, and 1395, unless in the delicts mentioned in can. 1395, §2, the superior decides that dismissal is not completely necessary and that correction of the member, restitution of justice, and reparation of scandal can be resolved sufficiently in another way. [<b></b>]</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. In these cases, after the proofs regarding the facts and imputability have been collected, the major superior is to make known the accusation and proofs to the member to be dismissed, giving the member the opportunity for self-defense. All the acts, signed by the major superior and a notary, together with the responses of the member, put in writing and signed by that member, are to be transmitted to the supreme moderator.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 696<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A member can also be dismissed for other causes provided that they are grave, external, imputable, and juridically proven such as: habitual neglect of the obligations of consecrated life; repeated violations of the sacred bonds; stubborn disobedience to the legitimate prescripts of superiors in a grave matter; grave scandal arising from the culpable behavior of the member; stubborn upholding or diffusion of doctrines condemned by the magisterium of the Church; public adherence to ideologies infected by materialism or atheism; the illegitimate absence mentioned in can. 665, §2, lasting six months; other causes of similar gravity which the proper law of the institute may determine.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. For the dismissal of a member in temporary vows, even causes of lesser gravity established in proper law are sufficient.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 697 In the cases mentioned in can. 696, if the major superior, after having heard the council, has decided that a process of dismissal must be begun:</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">1/</span> the major superior is to collect or complete the proofs;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">2/</span> the major superior is to warn the member in writing or before two witnesses with an explicit threat of subsequent dismissal unless the member reforms, with the cause for dismissal clearly indicated and full opportunity for self-defense given to the member; if the warning occurs in vain, however, the superior is to proceed to another warning after an intervening space of at least fifteen days;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">3/</span> if this warning also occurs in vain and the major superior with the council decides that incorrigibility is sufficiently evident and that the defenses of the member are insufficient, after fifteen days have elapsed from the last warning without effect, the major superior is to transmit to the supreme moderator all the acts, signed personally and by a notary, along with the signed responses of the member.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 698 In all the cases mentioned in cann. 695 and 696, the right of the member to communicate with and to offer defenses directly to the supreme moderator always remains intact.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 699<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The supreme moderator with the council, which must consist of at least four members for validity, is to proceed collegially to the accurate consideration of the proofs, arguments, and defenses; if it has been decided through secret ballot, the supreme moderator is to issue a decree of dismissal with the reasons in law and in fact expressed at least summarily for validity.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. In the autonomous monasteries mentioned in can. 615, it belongs to the diocesan bishop, to whom the superior is to submit the acts examined by the council, to decide on dismissal.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 700 A decree of dismissal does not have effect unless it has been confirmed by the Holy See, to which the decree and all the acts must be transmitted; if it concerns an institute of diocesan right, confirmation belongs to the bishop of the diocese where the house to which the religious has been attached is situated. To be valid, however, the decree must indicate the right which the dismissed possesses to make recourse to the competent authority within ten days from receiving notification. The recourse has suspensive effect.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 701 By legitimate dismissal, vows as well as the rights and obligations deriving from profession cease ipso facto.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless, if the member is a cleric, he cannot exercise sacred orders until he finds a bishop who receives him into the diocese after an appropriate probation according to the norm of can. 693 or at least permits him to exercise sacred orders.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 702<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Those who depart from a religious institute legitimately or have been dismissed from it legitimately can request nothing from the institute for any work done in it.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Nevertheless, the institute is to observe equity and the charity of the gospel toward a member who is separated from it.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 703 In the case of grave external scandal or of most grave imminent harm to the institute, a member can be expelled immediately from a religious house by the major superior or, if there is danger in delay, by the local superior with the consent of the council. If it is necessary, the major superior is to take care to begin a process of dismissal according to the norm of law or is to refer the matter to the Apostolic See.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 704 In the report referred to in can. 592, §1, which is to be sent to the Apostolic See, mention is to be made of members who have been separated from the institute in any way.</p>
  <h5 id="CHAPTER_VII.">CHAPTER VII. RELIGIOUS RAISED TO THE EPISCOPATE</h5>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 705 A religious raised to the episcopate remains a member of his institute but is subject only to the Roman Pontiff by virtue of the vow of obedience and is not bound by obligations which he himself prudently judges cannot be reconciled with his condition.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 706 The religious mentioned above:</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">1/</span> if he has lost the right of ownership of goods through profession, has the use, revenue, and administration of goods which accrue to him; a diocesan bishop and the others mentioned in can. 381, §2, however, acquire property on behalf of the particular church; others, on behalf of the institute or the Holy See insofar as the institute is capable or not of possession;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">2/</span> if he has not lost the right of ownership of goods through profession, recovers the use, revenue, and administration of the goods which he had; those things which accrue to him afterwards he fully acquires for himself;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">3/</span> in either case, however, must dispose of goods according to the intention of the donors when they do not accrue to him personally.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 707<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A retired religious bishop can choose a place of residence even outside the houses of his institute, unless the Apostolic See has provided otherwise.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. If he has served some diocese,&nbsp;can. 402, §2 is to be observed with respect to his appropriate and worthy support, unless his own institute wishes to provide such support; otherwise the Apostolic See is to provide in another manner.</p>
  <h5 id="CHAPTER_VIII.">CHAPTER VIII. CONFERENCES OF MAJOR SUPERIORS</h5>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 708 Major superiors can be associated usefully in conferences or councils so that by common efforts they work to achieve more fully the purpose of the individual institutes, always without prejudice to their autonomy, character, and proper spirit, or to transact common affairs, or to establish appropriate coordination and cooperation with the conferences of bishops and also with individual bishops.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 709 Conferences of major superiors are to have their own statutes approved by the Holy See, by which alone they can be erected even as a juridic person and under whose supreme direction they remain.</p>

  <h4 id="TITLE_III.">TITLE III. SECULAR INSTITUTES (Cann. 710 - 730)</h4>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 710 A secular institute is an institute of consecrated life in which the Christian faithful, living in the world, strive for the perfection of charity and seek to contribute to the sanctification of the world, especially from within.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 711 The consecration of a member of a secular institute does not change the member’s proper canonical condition among the people of God, whether lay or clerical, with due regard for the prescripts of the law which refer to institutes of consecrated life.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 712 Without prejudice to the prescripts of&nbsp;cann. 598-601, the constitutions are to establish the sacred bonds by which the evangelical counsels are assumed in the institute and are to define the obligations which these same bonds bring about; the proper secularity of the institute, however, is always to be preserved in its way of life.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 713<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1.

In the world and from the world, lay members participate in the evangelizing function of the Church whether through the witness of a Christian life and of fidelity toward their own consecration, or through the assistance they offer to order temporal things according to God and to inform the world by the power of the gospel.</p>
  <p>They also cooperate in the service of the ecclesial community according to their own secular way of life.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. Through the witness of consecrated life especially in the presbyterium, clerical members help their brothers by a particular apostolic charity, and by their sacred ministry among the people of God they bring about the sanctification of the world.</p>

  <p>Likewise, proper law is to define the obligations of the institute, especially Financial ones, towards members who carry on work for it.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 719<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1.
