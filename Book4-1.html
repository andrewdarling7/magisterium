  <h2 style="text-align: center;">BOOK IV. FUNCTION OF THE CHURCH</h2>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 834<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The Church fulfills its sanctifying function in a particular way through the sacred liturgy, which is an exercise of the priestly function of Jesus Christ. In the sacred liturgy the sanctification of humanity is signified through sensible signs and effected in a manner proper to each sign. In the sacred liturgy, the whole public worship of God is carried out by the Head and members of the mystical Body of Jesus Christ.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Such worship takes place when it is carried out in the name of the Church by persons legitimately designated and through acts approved by the authority of the Church.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 835<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The bishops in the first place exercise the sanctifying function; they are the high priests, the principal dispensers of the mysteries of God, and the directors, promoters, and guardians of the entire liturgical life in the church entrusted to them.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Presbyters also exercise this function; sharing in the priesthood of Christ and as his ministers under the authority of the bishop, they are consecrated to celebrate divine worship and to sanctify the people.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. Deacons have a part in the celebration of divine worship according to the norm of the prescripts of the law.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>4. The other members of the Christian faithful also have their own part in the function of sanctifying by participating actively in their own way in liturgical celebrations, especially the Eucharist. Parents share in a particular way in this function by leading a conjugal life in a Christian spirit and by seeing to the Christian education of their children.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 836 Since Christian worship, in which the common priesthood of the Christian faithful is carried out, is a work which proceeds from faith and is based on it, sacred ministers are to take care to arouse and enlighten this faith diligently, especially through the ministry of the word, which gives birth to and nourishes the faith.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 837<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Liturgical actions are not private actions but celebrations of the Church itself which is the sacrament of unity, that is, a holy people gathered and ordered under the bishops. Liturgical actions therefore belong to the whole body of the Church and manifest and affect it; they touch its individual members in different ways, however, according to the diversity of orders, functions, and actual participation.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Inasmuch as liturgical actions by their nature entail a common celebration, they are to be celebrated with the presence and active participation of the Christian faithful where possible.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 838n — §1. The ordering and guidance of the sacred liturgy depends solely upon the authority of the Church, namely, that of the Apostolic See and, as provided by law, that of the diocesan Bishop.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span> 2. It is for the Apostolic See to order the sacred liturgy of the universal Church, publish liturgical books, recognise adaptations approved by the Episcopal Conference according to the norm of law, and exercise vigilance that liturgical regulations are observed faithfully everywhere.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span> 3. It pertains to the Episcopal Conferences to faithfully prepare versions of the liturgical books in vernacular languages, suitably accommodated within defined limits, and to approve and publish the liturgical books for the regions for which they are responsible after the confirmation of the Apostolic See.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span> 4 Within the limits of his competence, it belongs to the diocesan Bishop to lay down in the Church entrusted to his care, liturgical regulations which are binding on all.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 839<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The Church carries out the function of sanctifying also by other means, both by prayers in which it asks God to sanctify the Christian faithful in truth, and by works of penance and charity which greatly help to root and strengthen the kingdom of Christ in souls and contribute to the salvation of the world.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Local ordinaries are to take care that the prayers and pious and sacred exercises of the Christian people are fully in keeping with the norms of the Church.</p>



  <h2 id="PARTI">PART I. THE SACRAMENTS</h2>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 840 The sacraments of the New Testament were instituted by Christ the Lord and entrusted to the Church. As actions of Christ and the Church, they are signs and means which express and strengthen the faith, render worship to God, and effect the sanctification of humanity and thus contribute in the greatest way to establish, strengthen, and manifest ecclesiastical communion. Accordingly, in the celebration of the sacraments the sacred ministers and the other members of the Christian faithful must use the greatest veneration and necessary diligence.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 841 Since the sacraments are the same for the whole Church and belong to the divine deposit, it is only for the supreme authority of the Church to approve or define the requirements for their validity; it is for the same or another competent authority according to the norm of can. 838<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>§3 and 4 to decide what pertains to their licit celebration, administration, and reception and to the order to be observed in their celebration.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 842<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A person who has not received baptism cannot be admitted validly to the other sacraments.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The sacraments of baptism, confirmation, and the Most Holy Eucharist are interrelated in such a way that they are required for full Christian initiation.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 843<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Sacred ministers cannot deny the sacraments to those who seek them at appropriate times, are properly disposed, and are not prohibited by law from receiving them.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Pastors of souls and other members of the Christian faithful, according to their respective ecclesiastical function, have the duty to take care that those who seek the sacraments are prepared to receive them by proper evangelization and catechetical instruction, attentive to the norms issued by competent authority.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 844<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Catholic ministers administer the sacraments licitly to Catholic members of the Christian faithful alone, who likewise receive them licitly from Catholic ministers alone, without prejudice to the prescripts of §§2, 3, and 4 of this canon, and can. 861, §2.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Whenever necessity requires it or true spiritual advantage suggests it, and provided that danger of error or of indifferentism is avoided, the Christian faithful for whom it is physically or morally impossible to approach a Catholic minister are permitted to receive the sacraments of penance, Eucharist, and anointing of the sick from non-Catholic ministers in whose Churches these sacraments are valid.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. Catholic ministers administer the sacraments of penance, Eucharist, and anointing of the sick licitly to members of Eastern Churches which do not have full communion with the Catholic Church if they seek such on their own accord and are properly disposed. This is also valid for members of other Churches which in the judgment of the Apostolic See are in the same condition in regard to the sacraments as these Eastern Churches.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>4. If the danger of death is present or if, in the judgment of the diocesan bishop or conference of bishops, some other grave necessity urges it, Catholic ministers administer these same sacraments licitly also to other Christians not having full communion with the Catholic Church, who cannot approach a minister of their own community and who seek such on their own accord, provided that they manifest Catholic faith in respect to these sacraments and are properly disposed.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>5. For the cases mentioned in §§2, 3, and 4, the diocesan bishop or conference of bishops is not to issue general norms except after consultation at least with the local competent authority of the interested non-Catholic Church or community.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 845<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Since the sacraments of baptism, confirmation, and orders imprint a character, they cannot be repeated.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. If after completing a diligent inquiry a prudent doubt still exists whether the sacraments mentioned in §1 were actually or validly conferred, they are to be conferred conditionally.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 846<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. In celebrating the sacraments the liturgical books approved by competent authority are to be observed faithfully; accordingly, no one is to add, omit, or alter anything in them on one’s own authority.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The minister is to celebrate the sacraments according to the minister’s own rite.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 847<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. In administering the sacraments in which holy oils must be used, the minister must use oils pressed from olives or other plants and, without prejudice to the prescript of can. 999, n. 2, consecrated or blessed recently by a bishop; he is not to use old oils unless it is necessary.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The pastor is to obtain the holy oils from his own bishop and is to preserve them diligently with proper care.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 848 The minister is to seek nothing for the administration of the sacraments beyond the offerings defined by competent authority, always taking care that the needy are not deprived of the assistance of the sacraments because of poverty.</p>



  <h4 id="BAPTISM">TITLE I. BAPTISM (Cann. 849 - 878)</h4>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 849 Baptism, the gateway to the sacraments and necessary for salvation by actual reception or at least by desire, is validly conferred only by a washing of true water with the proper form of words. Through baptism men and women are freed from sin, are reborn as children of God, and, configured to Christ by an indelible character, are incorporated into the Church.</p>

  <h5 id="CELEBRATIONOFBAPTISM">CHAPTER I. THE CELEBRATION OF BAPTISM</h5>

  <p><span class="tripleindent">2/</span> the parents of an infant to be baptized and those who are to undertake the function of sponsor are to be instructed properly on the meaning of this sacrament and the obligations attached to it.

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 859 If because of distance or other circumstances the one to be baptized cannot go or be brought to the parish church or to the other church or oratory mentioned in can. 858, §2 without grave inconvenience, baptism can and must be conferred in another nearer church or oratory, or even in another fitting place.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 860<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Apart from a case of necessity, baptism is not to be conferred in private houses, unless the local ordinary has permitted it for a grave cause.</p>

  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. When an ordinary minister is absent or impeded, a catechist or another person designated for this function by the local ordinary, or in a case of necessity any person with the right intention, confers baptism licitly. Pastors of souls, especially the pastor of a parish, are to be concerned that the Christian faithful are taught the correct way to baptize.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 862 Except in a case of necessity, no one is permitted to confer baptism in the territory of another without the required permission, not even upon his own subjects.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 863 The baptism of adults, at least of those who have completed their fourteenth year, is to be deferred to the diocesan bishop so that he himself administers it if he has judged it Expedient.</p>

  <h5 id="THOSETOBEBAPTIZED">CHAPTER III. THOSE TO BE BAPTIZED</h5>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 864 Every person not yet baptized and only such a person is capable of baptism.</p>

For an adult to be baptized, the person must have manifested the intention to receive baptism, have been instructed sufficiently about the truths of the faith and Christian obligations, and have been tested in the Christian life through the catechumenate. The adult is also to be urged to have sorrow for personal sins.</p>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 869<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. If there is a doubt whether a person has been baptized or whether baptism was conferred validly and the doubt remains after a serious investigation, baptism is to be conferred conditionally.</p>

  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. If in the cases mentioned in §§1 and 2 the conferral or validity of the baptism remains doubtful, baptism is not to be conferred until after the doctrine of the sacrament of baptism is explained to the person to be baptized, if an adult, and the reasons of the doubtful validity of the baptism are explained to the person or, in the case of an infant, to the parents.</p>

  <h4 id="SACRAMENTOFCONFIRMATION">TITLE II. THE SACRAMENT OF CONFIRMATION (Cann. 879 - 896)</h4>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 879 The sacrament of confirmation strengthens the baptized and obliges them more firmly to be witnesses of Christ by word and deed and to spread and defend the faith.

  <h5 id="MINISTEROFCONF">CHAPTER II. THE MINISTER OF CONFIRMATION</h5>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 882 The ordinary minister of confir-mation is a bishop; a presbyter provided with this faculty in virtue of universal law or the special grant of the competent authority also confers this sacrament validly.</p>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 887 A presbyter who possesses the faculty of administering confirmation also confers this sacrament licitly on externs in the territory assigned to him unless their proper ordinary prohibits it; he cannot confer it validly on anyone in another territory, without prejudice to the prescript of can. 883, n. 3.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 888 Within the territory in which they are able to confer confirmation, ministers can administer it even in exempt places.</p>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 891 The sacrament of confirmation is to be conferred on the faithful at about the age of discretion unless the conference of bishops has determined another age, or there is danger of death, or in the judgment of the minister a grave cause suggests otherwise.</p>

  <h5 id="SPONSORSCONF">CHAPTER IV. SPONSORS</h5>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 892 Insofar as possible, there is to be a sponsor for the person to be confirmed; the sponsor is to take care that the confirmed person behaves as a true witness of Christ and faithfully fulfills the obligations inherent in this sacrament.</p>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 896 If the pastor of the place was not present, the minister either personally or through another is to inform him as soon as possible of the conferral of confirmation.</p>



  <h4 id="MOSTHOLYEUCHARIST">TITLE III. THE MOST HOLY EUCHARIST (Cann. 897 - 958)</h4>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 897 The most August sacrament is the Most Holy Eucharist in which Christ the Lord himself is contained, offered, and received and by which the Church continually lives and grows. The eucharistic sacrifice, the memorial of the death and resurrection of the Lord, in which the sacrifice of the cross is perpetuated through the ages is the summit and source of all worship and Christian life, which signifies and effects the unity of the People of God and brings about the building up of the body of Christ. Indeed, the other sacraments and all the ecclesiastical works of the apostolate are closely connected with the Most Holy Eucharist and ordered to it.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 898 The Christian faithful are to hold the Most Holy Eucharist in highest honor, taking an active part in the celebration of the most august sacrifice, receiving this sacrament most devoutly and frequently, and worshiping it with the highest adoration. In explaining the doctrine about this sacrament, pastors of souls are to teach the faithful diligently about this obligation.</p>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 899<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The eucharistic celebration is the action of Christ himself and the Church. In it, Christ the Lord, through the ministry of the priest, offers himself, substantially present under the species of bread and wine, to God the Father and gives himself as spiritual food to the faithful united with his offering.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. In the eucharistic gathering the people of God are called together with the bishop or, under his authority, a presbyter presiding and acting in the person of Christ. All the faithful who are present, whether clerics or laity, unite together by participating in their own way according to the diversity of orders and liturgical functions.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. The eucharistic celebration is to be organized in such a way that all those participating receive from it the many fruits for which Christ the Lord instituted the eucharistic sacrifice.</p>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 903 A priest is to be permitted to celebrate even if the rector of the church does not know him, provided that either he presents a letter of introduction from his ordinary or superior, issued at least within the year, or it can be judged prudently that he is not impeded from celebrating.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 904 Remembering always that in the mystery of the eucharistic sacrifice the work of redemption is exercised continually, priests are to celebrate frequently; indeed, daily celebration is recommended earnestly since, even if the faithful cannot be present, it is the act of Christ and the Church in which priests fulfill their principal function.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 905<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A priest is not permitted to celebrate the Eucharist more than once a day except in cases where the law permits him to celebrate or concelebrate more than once on the same day.</p>

It is for the pastor to exercise vigilance so that children who have not attained the use of reason or whom he judges are not sufficiently disposed do not approach holy communion.</p>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 936 In the house of a religious institute or some other pious house, the Most Holy Eucharist is to be reserved only in the church or principal oratory attached to the house. For a just cause, however, the ordinary can also permit it to be reserved in another oratory of the same house.</p>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 949 A person obliged to celebrate and apply Mass for the intention of those who gave an offering is bound by the obligation even if the offerings received have been lost through no fault of his own.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 950 If a sum of money is offered for the application of Masses without an indication of the number of Masses to be celebrated, the number is to be computed on the basis of the offering established in the place where the donor resides, unless the intention of the donor must be presumed legitimately to have been different.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 951<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A priest who celebrates several Masses on the same day can apply each to the intention for which the offering was given, but subject to the rule that, except on Christmas, he is to keep the offering for only one Mass and transfer the others to the purposes prescribed by the ordinary, while allowing for some recompense by reason of an extrinsic title.</p>

Nevertheless, he is permitted to accept for the application of a Mass a voluntary offering which is larger or even smaller than the one defined.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Where there is no such decree, the custom in force in the diocese is to be observed.</p>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 953 No one is permitted to accept more offerings for Masses to be applied by himself than he can satisfy within a year.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 954 If in certain churches or oratories more Masses are asked to be celebrated than can be celebrated there, it is permitted for them to be celebrated elsewhere unless the donors have expressly indicated a contrary intention.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 955<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A person who intends to entrust to others the celebration of Masses to be applied is to entrust their celebration as soon as possible to priests acceptable to him, provided that he is certain that they are above suspicion. He must transfer the entire offering received unless it is certain that the excess over the sum fixed in the diocese was given for him personally. He is also obliged to see to the celebration of the Masses until he learns that the obligation has been accepted and the offering received.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The time within which Masses must be celebrated begins on the day the priest who is to celebrate them received them unless it is otherwise evident.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. Those who entrust to others Masses to be celebrated are to record in a book without delay both the Masses which they received and those which they transferred to others, as well as their offerings.</p>

  <h4 id="THESACRAMENTOFPENANCE">TITLE IV. THE SACRAMENT OF PENANCE (Cann. 959 - 997)</h4>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 959 In the sacrament of penance the faithful who confess their sins to a legitimate minister, are sorry for them, and intend to reform themselves obtain from God through the absolution imparted by the same minister forgiveness for the sins they have committed after baptism and, at the same, time are reconciled with the Church which they have wounded by sinning.</p>

  <h5 id="THECELEBRATIONPENANCE">CHAPTER I. THE CELEBRATION OF THE SACRAMENT</h5>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 960 Individual and integral confession and absolution constitute the only ordinary means by which a member of the faithful conscious of grave sin is reconciled with God and the Church. Only physical or moral impossibility excuses from confession of this type; in such a case reconciliation can be obtained by other means.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 961<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Absolution cannot be imparted in a general manner to many penitents at once without previous individual confession unless:</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">1/</span> danger of death is imminent and there is insufficient time for the priest or priests to hear the confessions of the individual penitents;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">2/</span> there is grave necessity, that is, when in view of the number of penitents, there are not enough confessors available to hear the confessions of individuals properly within a suitable period of time in such a way that the penitents are forced to be deprived for a long while of sacramental grace or holy communion through no fault of their own. Sufficient necessity is not considered to exist when confessors cannot be present due only to the large number of penitents such as can occur on some great feast or pilgrimage.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. It belongs to the diocesan bishop to judge whether the conditions required according to the norm of §1, n. 2 are present. He can determine the cases of such necessity, attentive to the criteria agreed upon with the other members of the conference of bishops.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 962<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. For a member of the Christian faithful validly to receive sacramental absolution given to many at one time, it is required not only that the person is properly disposed but also at the same time intends to confess within a suitable period of time each grave sin which at the present time cannot be so confessed.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Insofar as it can be done even on the occasion of the reception of general absolution, the Christian faithful are to be instructed about the requirements of the norm of §1. An exhortation that each person take care to make an act of contrition is to precede general absolution even in the case of danger of death, if there is time.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 963 Without prejudice to the obligation mentioned in can. 989, a person whose grave sins are remitted by general absolution is to approach individual confession as soon as possible, given the opportunity, before receiving another general absolution, unless a just cause intervenes.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 964<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The proper place to hear sacramental confessions is a church or oratory.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The conference of bishops is to establish norms regarding the confessional; it is to take care, however, that there are always confessionals with a fixed grate between the penitent and the confessor in an open place so that the faithful who wish to can use them freely.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. Confessions are not to be heard outside a confessional without a just cause.</p>

  <h5 id="THEMINISTERPENANCE">CHAPTER II. THE MINISTER OF THE SACRAMENT OF PENANCE</h5>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 965 A priest alone is the minister of the sacrament of penance.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 966<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The valid absolution of sins requires that the minister have, in addition to the power of orders, the faculty of exercising it for the faithful to whom he imparts absolution.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. A priest can be given this faculty either by the law itself or by a grant made by the competent authority according to the norm of can. 969.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 967<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. In addition to the Roman Pontiff, cardinals have the faculty of hearing the confessions of the Christian faithful everywhere in the world by the law itself. Bishops likewise have this faculty and use it licitly everywhere unless the diocesan bishop has denied it in a particular case.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Those who possess the faculty of hearing confessions habitually whether by virtue of office or by virtue of the grant of an ordinary of the place of incardination or of the place in which they have a domicile can exercise that faculty everywhere unless the local ordinary has denied it in a particular case, without prejudice to the prescripts of can. 974, §§2 and 3.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. Those who are provided with the faculty of hearing confessions by reason of office or grant of a competent superior according to the norm of cann. 968, §2 and 969, §2 possess the same faculty everywhere by the law itself as regards members and others living day and night in the house of the institute or society; they also use the faculty licitly unless some major superior has denied it in a particular case as regards his own subjects.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 968<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. In virtue of office, a local ordinary, canon penitentiary, a pastor, and those who take the place of a pastor possess the faculty of hearing confessions, each within his jurisdiction.</p>

In virtue of their office, superiors of religious institutes or societies of apostolic life that are clerical and of pontifical right, who have executive power of governance according to the norm of their constitutions, possess the faculty of hearing the confessions of their subjects and of others living day and night in the house, without prejudice to the prescript of can. 630, §4.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 969<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The local ordinary alone is competent to confer upon any presbyters whatsoever the faculty to hear the confessions of any of the faithful.

  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The superior of a religious institute or society of apostolic life mentioned in can. 968, §2 is competent to confer upon any presbyters whatsoever the faculty to hear the confessions of their subjects and of others living day and night in the house.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 970 The faculty to hear confessions is not to be granted except to presbyters who are found to be suitable through an examination or whose suitability is otherwise evident.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 971 The local ordinary is not to grant the faculty of hearing confessions habitually to a presbyter, even one having a domicile or quasi-domicile in his jurisdiction, unless he has first heard the ordinary of the same presbyter insofar as possible.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 972 The competent authority mentioned in can. 969 can grant the faculty to hear confessions for either an indefinite or a definite period of time.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 973 The faculty to hear confessions habitually is to be granted in writing.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 974<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The local ordinary and the competent superior are not to revoke the faculty to hear confessions habitually except for a grave cause.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. When the faculty to hear confessions has been revoked by the local ordinary who granted it as mentioned in can. 967, §2, a presbyter loses the faculty everywhere. If some other local ordinary has revoked the faculty, the presbyter loses it only in the territory of the one who revokes it.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. Any local ordinary who has revoked the faculty of some presbyter to hear confessions is to inform the proper ordinary of incardination of the presbyter or, if he is a member of a religious institute, his competent superior.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>4. If the proper major superior of a presbyter has revoked the faculty to hear confessions, the presbyter loses the faulty to hear the confessions of members of the institute everywhere. If some other competent superior has revoked the faculty, however, the presbyter loses it only with regard to the subjects in the jurisdiction of that superior.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 975 Besides by revocation, the faculty mentioned in can. 967, §2 ceases by loss of office, excardination, or loss of domicile.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 976 Even though a priest lacks the faculty to hear confessions, he absolves validly and licitly any penitents whatsoever in danger of death from any censures and sins, even if an approved priest is present.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 977 The absolution of an accomplice in a sin against the sixth commandment of the Decalogue is invalid except in danger of death.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 978<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. In hearing confessions the priest is to remember that he is equally a judge and a physician and has been established by God as a minister of divine justice and mercy, so that he has regard for the divine honor and the salvation of souls.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. In administering the sacrament, the confessor as a minister of the Church is to adhere faithfully to the doctrine of the magisterium and the norms issued by competent authority.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 979 In posing questions, the priest is to proceed with prudence and discretion, attentive to the condition and age of the penitent, and is to refrain from asking the name of an accomplice.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 980 If the confessor has no doubt about the disposition of the penitent, and the penitent seeks absolution, absolution is to be neither refused nor deferred.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 981 The confessor is to impose salutary and suitable penances in accord with the quality and number of sins, taking into account the condition of the penitent. The penitent is obliged to fulfill these personally.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 982 Whoever confesses to have denounced falsely an innocent confessor to ecclesiastical authority concerning the crime of solicitation to sin against the sixth commandment of the Decalogue is not to be absolved unless the person has first formally retracted the false denunciation and is prepared to repair damages if there are any.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 983<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The sacramental seal is inviolable; therefore it is absolutely forbidden for a confessor to betray in any way a penitent in words or in any manner and for any reason.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The interpreter, if there is one, and all others who in any way have knowledge of sins from confession are also obliged to observe secrecy.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 984<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A confessor is prohibited completely from using knowledge acquired from confession to the detriment of the penitent even when any danger of revelation is excluded.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. A person who has been placed in authority cannot use in any manner for external governance the knowledge about sins which he has received in confession at any time.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 985 The director of novices and his associate and the rector of a seminary or other institute of education are not to hear the sacramental confessions of their students residing in the same house unless the students freely request it in particular cases.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 986<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. All to whom the care of souls has been entrusted in virtue of some function are obliged to make provision so that the confessions of the faithful entrusted to them are heard when they reasonably seek to be heard and that they have the opportunity to approach individual confession on days and at times established for their convenience.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. In urgent necessity, any confessor is obliged to hear the confessions of the Christian faithful, and in danger of death, any priest is so obliged.</p>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 988<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A member of the Christian faithful is obliged to confess in kind and number all grave sins committed after baptism and not yet remitted directly through the keys of the Church nor acknowledged in individual confession, of which the person has knowledge after diligent examination of conscience.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. It is recommended to the Christian faithful that they also confess venial sins.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 989 After having reached the age of discretion, each member of the faithful is ob-liged to confess faithfully his or her grave sins at least once a year.</p>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 992 An indulgence is the remission before God of temporal punishment for sins whose guilt is already forgiven, which a properly disposed member of the Christian faithful gains under certain and defined conditions by the assistance of the Church which as minister of redemption dispenses and applies authoritatively the treasury of the satisfactions of Christ and the saints.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 993 An indulgence is partial or plenary insofar as it partially or totally frees from the temporal punishment due to sins.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 994 Any member of the faithful can gain partial or plenary indulgences for oneself or apply them to the dead by way of suffrage.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 995<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. In addition to the supreme authority of the Church, only those to whom this power is acknowledged in the law or granted by the Roman Pontiff can bestow indulgences.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. No authority below the Roman Pontiff can entrust the power of granting indulgences to others unless the Apostolic See has given this expressly to the person.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 996<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. To be capable of gaining indulgences, a person must be baptized, not excommunicated, and in the state of grace at least at the end of the prescribed works.</p>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 997 As regards the granting and use of indulgences, the other prescripts contained in the special laws of the Church must also be observed.</p>

  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. If it is a question of the irregularity from voluntary homicide or a procured abortion, the number of the delicts also must be mentioned for the validity of the dispensation.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. A general dispensation from irregularities and impediments to receive orders is valid for all the orders.</p>

  <h6 id="REQUIREDDOCSORDINATION">Art. 4. THE REQUIRED DOCUMENTS AND INVESTIGATION</h6>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1050 For a person to be promoted to sacred orders, the following documents are required:</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">1/</span> a testimonial that studies have been properly completed according to the norm of can. 1032;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">2/</span> for those to be ordained to the presbyterate, a testimonial that the diaconate was received;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">3/</span> for candidates to the diaconate, a testimonial that baptism, confirmation and the ministries mentioned in can. 1035 were received; likewise, a testimonial that the declaration mentioned in can. 1036 was made, and if the one to be ordained to the permanent diaconate is a married candidate, testimonials that the marriage was celebrated and the wife consents.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1051 The following prescripts regarding the investigation about the qualities required in the one to be ordained are to be observed:</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">1/</span> there is to be a testimonial of the rector of the seminary or house of formation about the qualities required to receive the order, that is, about the sound doctrine of the candidate, his genuine piety, good morals, and aptitude to exercise the ministry, as well as, after a properly executed inquiry, about his state of physical and psychic health;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">2/</span> in order to conduct the investigation properly, the diocesan bishop or major superior can employ other means which seem useful to him according to the circumstances of time and place, such as testimonial letters, public announcements, or other sources of information.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1052<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. For a bishop conferring ordination by his own right to proceed to the ordination, he must be sure that the documents mentioned in can. 1050 are at hand and that, after the investigation has been conducted according to the norm of law, positive arguments have proven the suitability of the candidate.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. For a bishop to proceed to the ordination of someone who is not his subject, it is sufficient that the dimissorial letters mention that the same documents are at hand, that the investigation has been performed according to the norm of the law, and that the suitability of the candidate has been established. Moreover, if the candidate is a member of a religious institute or a society of apostolic life, the same letters must also attest that he has been received definitively into the institute or society and is a subject of the superior who gives the letters.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. If, all these notwithstanding, the bishop doubts for specific reasons whether a candidate is suitable to receive orders, he is not to promote him.</p>

  <h5 id="NOTATIONANDTESTIMONIALORD">CHAPTER III. THE NOTATION AND TESTIMONIAL OF ORDINATION CONFERRED</h5>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1053<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. After an ordination has taken place, the names of those ordained and of the ordaining minister and the place and date of the ordination are to be noted in a special register to be kept carefully in the curia of the place of ordination; all the documents of individual ordinations are to be preserved carefully.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The ordaining bishop is to give to each of the ordained an authentic testimonial of the reception of ordination; if a bishop other than their own promoted them with dimissorial letters, they are to show the testimonial to their own ordinary for notation of the ordination in a special register to be kept in the archive.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1054 The local ordinary if it concerns seculars, or the competent major superior if it concerns his own subjects, is to send notice of each ordination celebrated to the pastor of the place of baptism, who is to record it in his baptismal register according to the norm of can. 535, §2.</p>



  <h4 id="MARRIAGE">TITLE VII. MARRIAGE (Cann. 1055 - 1165)</h4>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1055<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The matrimonial covenant, by which a man and a woman establish between themselves a partnership of the whole of life and which is ordered by its nature to the good of the spouses and the procreation and education of offspring, has been raised by Christ the Lord to the dignity of a sacrament between the baptized.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. For this reason, a valid matrimonial contract cannot exist between the baptized without it being by that fact a sacrament.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1056 The essential properties of marriage are unity and indissolubility, which in Christian marriage obtain a special firmness by reason of the sacrament.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1057<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The consent of the parties, legitimately manifested between persons quali-fied by law, makes marriage; no human power is able to supply this consent.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Matrimonial consent is an act of the will by which a man and a woman mutually give and accept each other through an irrevocable covenant in order to establish marriage.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1058 All persons who are not prohibited by law can contract marriage.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1059 Even if only one party is Catholic, the marriage of Catholics is governed not only by divine law but also by canon law, without prejudice to the competence of civil authority concerning the merely civil effects of the same marriage.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1060 Marriage possesses the favor of law; therefore, in a case of doubt, the validity of a marriage must be upheld until the contrary is proven.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1061<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A valid marriage between the baptized is called ratum tantum if it has not been consummated; it is called ratum et consummatum if the spouses have performed between themselves in a human fashion a conjugal act which is suitable in itself for the procreation of offspring, to which marriage is ordered by its nature and by which the spouses become one flesh.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. After a marriage has been celebrated, if the spouses have lived together consummation is presumed until the contrary is proven.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. An invalid marriage is called putative if at least one party celebrated it in good faith, until both parties become certain of its nullity.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1062<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A promise of marriage, whether unilateral or bilateral, which is called an engagement, is governed by the particular law established by the conference of bishops, after it has considered any existing customs and civil laws.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. A promise to marry does not give rise to an action to seek the celebration of marriage; an action to repair damages, however, does arise if warranted.</p>

  <h5 id="PASTORALCAREPRECEDING">CHAPTER I. PASTORAL CARE AND THOSE THINGS WHICH MUST PRECEDE THE CELEBRATION OF MARRIAGE</h5>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1063 Pastors of souls are obliged to take care that their ecclesiastical community offers the Christian faithful the assistance by which the matrimonial state is preserved in a Christian spirit and advances in perfection. This assistance must be offered especially by:</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">1/</span> preaching, catechesis adapted to minors, youth, and adults, and even the use of instruments of social communication, by which the Christian faithful are instructed about the meaning of Christian marriage and about the function of Christian spouses and parents;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">2/</span> personal preparation to enter marriage, which disposes the spouses to the holiness and duties of their new state;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">3/</span> a fruitful liturgical celebration of marriage which is to show that the spouses signify and share in the mystery of the unity and fruitful love between Christ and the Church;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">4/</span> help offered to those who are married, so that faithfully preserving and protecting the conjugal covenant, they daily come to lead holier and fuller lives in their family.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1064 It is for the local ordinary to take care that such assistance is organized fit-tingly, after he has also heard men and women proven by experience and expertise if it seems opportune.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1065<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Catholics who have not yet received the sacrament of confirmation are to receive it before they are admitted to marriage if it can be done without grave inconvenience.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. To receive the sacrament of marriage fruitfully, spouses are urged especially to approach the sacraments of penance and of the Most Holy Eucharist.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1066 Before a marriage is celebrated, it must be evident that nothing stands in the way of its valid and licit celebration.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1067 The conference of bishops is to establish norms about the examination of spouses and about the marriage banns or other opportune means to accomplish the investigations necessary before marriage. After these norms have been diligently observed, the pastor can proceed to assist at the marriage.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1068 In danger of death and if other proofs cannot be obtained, the aYrmation of the contracting parties, even sworn if the case warrants it, that they are baptized and are prevented by no impediment is sufficient unless there are indications to the contrary.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1069 All the faithful are obliged to reveal any impediments they know about to the pastor or local ordinary before the celebration of the marriage.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1070 If someone other than the pastor who is to assist at marriage has conducted the investigations, the person is to notify the pastor about the results as soon as possible through an authentic document.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1071<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Except in a case of necessity, a person is not to assist without the permission of the local ordinary at:</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">1/</span> a marriage of transients;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">2/</span> a marriage which cannot be recognized or celebrated according to the norm of civil law;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">3/</span> a marriage of a person who is bound by natural obligations toward another party or children arising from a previous union;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">4/</span> a marriage of a person who has notoriously rejected the Catholic faith;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">5/</span> a marriage of a person who is under a censure;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">6/</span> a marriage of a minor child when the parents are unaware or reasonably opposed;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">7/</span> a marriage to be entered into through a proxy as mentioned in can. 1105.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The local ordinary is not to grant permission to assist at the marriage of a person who has notoriously rejected the Catholic faith unless the norms mentioned in can. 1125 have been observed with necessary adaptation.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1072 Pastors of souls are to take care to dissuade youth from the celebration of marriage before the age at which a person usually enters marriage according to the accepted practices of the region.</p>

  <h5 id="DIRIMENTIMPEDIMENTS">CHAPTER II. DIRIMENT IMPEDIMENTS IN GENERAL</h5>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1073 A diriment impediment renders a person unqualified to contract marriage validly.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1074 An impediment which can be proven in the external forum is considered to be public; otherwise it is occult.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1075<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. It is only for the supreme authority of the Church to declare authentically when divine law prohibits or nullifies marriage.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Only the supreme authority has the right to establish other impediments for the baptized.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1076 A custom which introduces a new impediment or is contrary to existing impediments is reprobated.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1077<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. In a special case, the local ordinary can prohibit marriage for his own subjects residing anywhere and for all actually present in his own territory but only for a time, for a grave cause, and for as long as the cause continues.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Only the supreme authority of the Church can add a nullifying clause to a prohibition.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1078<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The local ordinary can dispense his own subjects residing anywhere and all actually present in his own territory from all impediments of ecclesiastical law except those whose dispensation is reserved to the Apostolic See.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Impediments whose dispensation is reserved to the Apostolic See are:</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">1/</span> the impediment arising from sacred orders or from a public perpetual vow of chastity in a religious institute of pontifical right;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">2/</span> the impediment of crime mentioned in can. 1090.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. A dispensation is never given from the impediment of consanguinity in the direct line or in the second degree of the collateral line.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1079<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. In urgent danger of death, the local ordinary can dispense his own subjects residing anywhere and all actually present in his territory both from the form to be observed in the celebration of marriage and from each and every impediment of ecclesiastical law, whether public or occult, except the impediment arising from the sacred order of presbyterate.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. In the same circumstances mentioned in §1, but only for cases in which the local ordinary cannot be reached, the pastor, the properly delegated sacred minister, and the priest or deacon who assists at marriage according to the norm of can. 1116, §2 possess the same power of dispensing.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. In danger of death a confessor possesses the power of dispensing from occult impediments for the internal forum, whether within or outside the act of sacramental confession.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>4. In the case mentioned in §2, the local ordinary is not considered accessible if he can be reached only through telegraph or telephone.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1080<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Whenever an impediment is discovered after everything has already been prepared for the wedding, and the marriage cannot be delayed without probable danger of grave harm until a dispensation is obtained from the competent authority, the local ordinary and, provided that the case is occult, all those mentioned in can. 1079, §§2-3 when the conditions prescribed therein have been observed possess the power of dispensing from all impediments except those mentioned in can. 1078, §2, n. 1.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. This power is valid even to convalidate a marriage if there is the same danger in delay and there is insufficient time to make recourse to the Apostolic See or to the local ordinary concerning impediments from which he is able to dispense.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1081 The pastor or the priest or deacon mentioned in can. 1079, §2 is to notify the local ordinary immediately about a dispensation granted for the external forum; it is also to be noted in the marriage register.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1082 Unless a rescript of the Penitentiary provides otherwise, a dispensation from an occult impediment granted in the non-sacramental internal forum is to be noted in a book which must be kept in the secret archive of the curia; no other dispensation for the external forum is necessary if afterwards the occult impediment becomes public.</p>

  <h5 id="SPECIFICDIRIMENTIMP">CHAPTER III. SPECIFIC DIRIMENT IMPEDIMENTS</h5>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1083<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A man before he has completed his sixteenth year of age and a woman before she has completed her fourteenth year of age cannot enter into a valid marriage.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The conference of bishops is free to establish a higher age for the licit celebration of marriage.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1084<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Antecedent and perpetual impotence to have intercourse, whether on the part of the man or the woman, whether absolute or relative, nullifies marriage by its very nature.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. If the impediment of impotence is doubtful, whether by a doubt about the law or a doubt about a fact, a marriage must not be impeded nor, while the doubt remains, declared null.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. Sterility neither prohibits nor nullifies marriage, without prejudice to the prescript of can. 1098.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1085<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A person bound by the bond of a prior marriage, even if it was not consummated, invalidly attempts marriage.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Even if the prior marriage is invalid or dissolved for any reason, it is not on that account permitted to contract another before the nullity or dissolution of the prior marriage is established legitimately and certainly.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1086<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A marriage between two persons, one of whom was baptized in the Catholic Church or received into it, and the other of whom is not baptized, is invalid.</p>

  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. If at the time the marriage was contracted one party was commonly held to have been baptized or the baptism was doubtful, the validity of the marriage must be presumed according to the norm of can. 1060 until it is proven with certainty that one party was baptized but the other was not.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1087 Those in sacred orders invalidly attempt marriage.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1088 Those bound by a public perpetual vow of chastity in a religious institute invalidly attempt marriage.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1089 No marriage can exist between a man and a woman who has been abducted or at least detained with a view of contracting marriage with her unless the woman chooses marriage of her own accord after she has been separated from the captor and established in a safe and free place.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1090<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Anyone who with a view to entering marriage with a certain person has brought about the death of that person’s spouse or of one’s own spouse invalidly attempts this marriage.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Those who have brought about the death of a spouse by mutual physical or moral cooperation also invalidly attempt a marriage together.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1091<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. In the direct line of consanguinity marriage is invalid between all ancestors and descendants, both legitimate and natural.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. In the collateral line marriage is invalid up to and including the fourth degree.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. The impediment of consanguinity is not multiplied.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>4. A marriage is never permitted if doubt exists whether the partners are related by consanguinity in any degree of the direct line or in the second degree of the collateral line.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1092 Affinity in the direct line in any degree invalidates a marriage.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1093 The impediment of public propriety arises from an invalid marriage after the establishment of common life or from notorious or public concubinage. It nullifies marriage in the first degree of the direct line between the man and the blood relatives of the woman, and vice versa.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1094 Those who are related in the direct line or in the second degree of the collateral line by a legal relationship arising from adoption cannot contract marriage together validly.</p>

  <h5 id="MATRIMONIALCONSENT">CHAPTER IV. MATRIMONIAL CONSENT</h5>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1095 The following are incapable of contracting marriage:</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">1/</span> those who lack the sufficient use of reason;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">2/</span> those who suffer from a grave defect of discretion of judgment concerning the essential matrimonial rights and duties mutually to be handed over and accepted;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">3/</span> those who are not able to assume the essential obligations of marriage for causes of a psychic nature.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1096<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. For matrimonial consent to exist, the contracting parties must be at least not ignorant that marriage is a permanent partnership between a man and a woman ordered to the procreation of offspring by means of some sexual cooperation.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. This ignorance is not presumed after puberty.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1097<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Error concerning the person renders a marriage invalid.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Error concerning a quality of the person does not render a marriage invalid even if it is the cause for the contract, unless this quality is directly and principally intended.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1098 A person contracts invalidly who enters into a marriage deceived by malice, perpetrated to obtain consent, concerning some quality of the other partner which by its very nature can gravely disturb the partnership of conjugal life.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1099 Error concerning the unity or indissolubility or sacramental dignity of marriage does not vitiate matrimonial consent provided that it does not determine the will.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1100 The knowledge or opinion of the nullity of a marriage does not necessarily exclude matrimonial consent.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1101<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The internal consent of the mind is presumed to conform to the words and signs used in celebrating the marriage.</p>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1102<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A marriage subject to a condition about the future cannot be contracted validly.</p>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1105<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. To enter into a marriage validly by proxy it is required that:</p>

  <p><span class="tripleindent">2/</span> the proxy is designated by the one mandating and fulfills this function personally.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. To be valid the mandate must be signed by the one mandating and by the pastor or ordinary of the place where the mandate is given, or by a priest delegated by either of them, or at least by two witnesses, or it must be made by means of a document which is authentic according to the norm of civil law.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. If the one mandating cannot write, this is to be noted in the mandate itself and another witness is to be added who also signs the document; otherwise, the mandate is invalid.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>4. If the one mandating revokes the mandate or develops amentia before the proxy contracts in his or her name, the marriage is invalid even if the proxy or the other contracting party does not know this.</p>

  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The person who assists at a marriage is understood to be only that person who is present, asks for the manifestation of the consent of the contracting parties, and receives it in the name of the Church.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1109 Unless the local ordinary and pastor have been excommunicated, interdicted, or suspended from office or declared such through a sentence or decree, by virtue of their office and within the confines of their territory they assist validly at the marriages not only of their subjects but also of those who are not their subjects provided that one of them is of the Latin rite.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1110 By virtue of office, a personal ordinary and a personal pastor assist validly only at marriages where at least one of the parties is a subject within the confines of their jurisdiction.</p>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1113 Before special delegation is granted, all those things which the law has established to prove free status are to be fulfilled.</p>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1115 Marriages are to be celebrated in a parish where either of the contracting parties has a domicile, quasidomicile, or month long residence or, if it concerns transients, in the parish where they actually reside.

A marriage between Catholics or between a Catholic party and a non-Catholic baptized party is to be celebrated in a parish church. It can be celebrated in another church or oratory with the permission of the local ordinary or pastor.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The local ordinary can permit a marriage to be celebrated in another suitable place.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. A marriage between a Catholic party and a non-baptized party can be celebrated in a church or in another suitable place.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1119 Outside the case of necessity, the rites prescribed in the liturgical books approved by the Church or received by legitimate customs are to be observed in the celebration of a marriage.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1120 The conference of bishops can produce its own rite of marriage, to be reviewed by the Holy See, in keeping with the usages of places and peoples which are adapted to the Christian spirit; nevertheless, the law remains in effect that the person who assists at the marriage is present, asks for the manifestation of consent of the contracting parties, and receives it.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1121<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. After a marriage has been celebrated, the pastor of the place of the celebration or the person who takes his place, even if neither assisted at the marriage, is to note as soon as possible in the marriage register the names of the spouses, the person who assisted, and the witnesses, and the place and date of the celebration of the marriage according to the method prescribed by the conference of bishops or the diocesan bishop.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Whenever a marriage is contracted according to the norm of can. 1116, a priest or deacon, if he was present at the celebration, or otherwise the witnesses in solidum with the contracting parties are bound to inform as soon as possible the pastor or local ordinary about the marriage entered into.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. For a marriage contracted with a dispensation from canonical form, the local ordinary who granted the dispensation is to take care that the dispensation and celebration are inscribed in the marriage registers of both the curia and the proper parish of the Catholic party whose pastor conducted the investigation about the free status. The Catholic spouse is bound to notify as soon as possible the same ordinary and pastor about the marriage celebrated and also to indicate the place of the celebration and the public form observed.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1122<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The contracted marriage is to be noted also in the baptismal registers in which the baptism of the spouses has been recorded.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. If a spouse did not contract marriage in the parish in which the person was baptized, the pastor of the place of the celebration is to send notice of the marriage which has been entered into as soon as possible to the pastor of the place of the conferral of baptism.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1123 Whenever a marriage is either convalidated in the external forum, declared null, or legitimately dissolved other than by death, the pastor of the place of the celebration of the marriage must be informed so that a notation is properly made in the marriage and baptismal registers.</p>

  <h5 id="MIXEDMARRIAGES">CHAPTER VI. MIXED MARRIAGES</h5>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1124 Marriage between two baptized persons, one of whom was baptized in the Catholic Church or received into it after baptism, and the other a member of a Church or ecclesial community not in full communion with the Catholic Church, cannot be celebrated without the express permission of the competent authority.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1125 The local ordinary can grant a permission of this kind if there is a just and reasonable cause. He is not to grant it unless the following conditions have been fulfilled:</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">1/</span> the Catholic party is to declare that he or she is prepared to remove dangers of defecting from the faith and is to make a sincere promise to do all in his or her power so that all offspring are baptized and brought up in the Catholic Church;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">2/</span> the other party is to be informed at an appropriate time about the promises which the Catholic party is to make, in such a way that it is certain that he or she is truly aware of the promise and obligation of the Catholic party;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">3/</span> both parties are to be instructed about the purposes and essential properties of marriage which neither of the contracting parties is to exclude.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1126 It is for the conference of bishops to establish the method in which these declarations and promises, which are always required, must be made and to define the manner in which they are to be established in the external forum and the non-Catholic party informed about them.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1127<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The prescripts of can. 1108 are to be observed for the form to be used in a mixed marriage. Nevertheless, if a Catholic party contracts marriage with a non-Catholic party of an Eastern rite, the canonical form of the celebration must be observed for liceity only; for validity, however, the presence of a sacred minister is required and the other requirements of law are to be observed.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. If grave difficulties hinder the observance of canonical form, the local ordinary of the Catholic party has the right of dispensing from the form in individual cases, after having consulted the ordinary of the place in which the marriage is celebrated and with some public form of celebration for validity. It is for the conference of bishops to establish norms by which the aforementioned dispensation is to be granted in a uniform manner.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. It is forbidden to have another religious celebration of the same marriage to give or renew matrimonial consent before or after the canonical celebration according to the norm of §1. Likewise, there is not to be a religious celebration in which the Catholic who is assisting and a non-Catholic minister together, using their own rites, ask for the consent of the parties.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1128 Local ordinaries and other pastors of souls are to take care that the Catholic spouse and the children born of a mixed marriage do not lack the spiritual help to fulfill their obligations and are to help spouses foster the unity of conjugal and family life.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1129 The prescripts of cann. 1127 and 1128 must be applied also to marriages which the impediment of disparity of cult mentioned in can. 1086, §1 impedes.</p>

  <h5 id="SECRETMARRIAGE">CHAPTER VII. MARRIAGE CELEBRATED SECRETLY</h5>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1130 For a grave and urgent cause, the local ordinary can permit a marriage to be celebrated secretly.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1131 Permission to celebrate a marriage secretly entails the following:</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">1/</span> the investigations which must be conducted before the marriage are done secretly;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">2/</span> the local ordinary, the one assisting, the witnesses, and the spouses observe secrecy about the marriage celebrated.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1132 The obligation of observing the secrecy mentioned in can. 1131, n. 2 ceases on the part of the local ordinary if grave scandal or grave harm to the holiness of marriage is imminent due to the observance of the secret; this is to be made known to the parties before the celebration of the marriage.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1133 A marriage celebrated secretly is to be noted only in a special register to be kept in the secret archive of the curia.</p>

  <h5 id="EFFECTSOFMARRIAGE">CHAPTER VIII. THE EFFECTS OF MARRIAGE</h5>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1134 From a valid marriage there arises between the spouses a bond which by its nature is perpetual and exclusive. Moreover, a special sacrament strengthens and, as it were, consecrates the spouses in a Christian marriage for the duties and dignity of their state.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1135 Each spouse has an equal duty and right to those things which belong to the partnership of conjugal life.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1136 Parents have the most grave duty and the primary right to take care as best they can for the physical, social, cultural, moral, and religious education of their offspring.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1137 The children conceived or born of a valid or putative marriage are legitimate.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1138<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The father is he whom a lawful marriage indicates unless clear evidence proves the contrary.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Children born at least 180 days after the day when the marriage was celebrated or within 300 days from the day of the dissolution of conjugal life are presumed to be legitimate.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1139 Illegitimate children are legitimated by the subsequent valid or putative marriage of their parents or by a rescript of the Holy See.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1140 As regards canonical effects, legitimated children are equal in all things to legitimate ones unless the law has expressly provided otherwise.</p>

  <h6 id="DISSOLUTION">Art. 1. DISSOLUTION OF THE BOND</h6>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1141 A marriage that is ratum et consummatum can be dissolved by no human power and by no cause, except death.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1142 For a just cause, the Roman Pontiff can dissolve a non-consummated marriage between baptized persons or between a baptized party and a non-baptized party at the request of both parties or of one of them, even if the other party is unwilling.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1143<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A marriage entered into by two non-baptized persons is dissolved by means of the pauline privilege in favor of the faith of the party who has received baptism by the very fact that a new marriage is contracted by the same party, provided that the non-baptized party departs.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The non-baptized party is considered to depart if he or she does not wish to cohabit with the baptized party or to cohabit peacefully without affront to the Creator unless the baptized party, after baptism was received, has given the other a just cause for departing.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1144<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. For the baptized party to contract a new marriage validly, the non-baptized party must always be interrogated whether:</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">1/</span> he or she also wishes to receive baptism;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">2/</span> he or she at least wishes to cohabit peacefully with the baptized party without affront to the Creator.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. This interrogation must be done after baptism. For a grave cause, however, the local ordinary can permit the interrogation to be done before baptism or can even dispense from the interrogation either before or after baptism provided that it is evident at least by a summary and extrajudicial process that it cannot be done or would be useless.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1145<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The interrogation is regularly to be done on the authority of the local ordinary of the converted party. This ordinary must grant the other spouse a period of time to respond if the spouse seeks it, after having been advised, however, that his or her silence will be considered a negative response if the period passes without effect.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Even an interrogation made privately by the converted party is valid and indeed licit if the form prescribed above cannot be observed.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. In either case, the fact that the interrogation was done and its outcome must be established legitimately in the external forum.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1146 The baptized party has the right to contract a new marriage with a Catholic party:</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">1/</span> if the other party responded negatively to the interrogation or if the interrogation had been omitted legitimately;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">2/</span> if the non-baptized party, already interrogated or not, at first persevered in peaceful cohabitation without affront to the Creator but then departed without a just cause, without prejudice to the prescripts of cann. 1144 and 1145.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1147 For a grave cause, however, the local ordinary can allow a baptized party who uses the pauline privilege to contract marriage with a non-Catholic party, whether baptized or not baptized; the prescripts of the canons about mixed marriages are also to be observed.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1148<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. When he receives baptism in the Catholic Church, a non-baptized man who has several non-baptized wives at the same time can retain one of them after the others have been dismissed, if it is hard for him to remain with the first one. The same is valid for a non-baptized woman who has several non-baptized husbands at the same time.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. In the cases mentioned in §1, marriage must be contracted in legitimate form after baptism has been received, and the prescripts about mixed marriages, if necessary, and other matters required by the law are to be observed.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. Keeping in mind the moral, social, and economic conditions of places and of persons, the local ordinary is to take care that the needs of the first wife and the others dismissed are sufficiently provided for according to the norms of justice, Christian charity, and natural equity.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1149 A non-baptized person who, after having received baptism in the Catholic Church, cannot restore cohabitation with a non-baptized spouse by reason of captivity or persecution can contract another marriage even if the other party has received baptism in the meantime, without prejudice to the prescript of can. 1141.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1150 In a doubtful matter the privilege of faith possesses the favor of the law.</p>

  <h6 id="SEPARATIONBONDREMAINS">Art. 2. SEPARATION WITH THE BOND REMAINING</h6>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1151 Spouses have the duty and right to preserve conjugal living unless a legitimate cause excuses them.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1152<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Although it is earnestly recommended that a spouse, moved by Christian charity and concerned for the good of the family, not refuse forgiveness to an adulterous partner and not disrupt conjugal life, nevertheless, if the spouse did not condone the fault of the other expressly or tacitly, the spouse has the right to sever conjugal living unless the spouse consented to the adultery, gave cause for it, or also committed adultery.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Tacit condonation exists if the innocent spouse has had marital relations voluntarily with the other spouse after having become certain of the adultery. It is presumed, moreover, if the spouse observed conjugal living for six months and did not make recourse to the ecclesiastical or civil authority.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. If the innocent spouse has severed conjugal living voluntarily, the spouse is to introduce a cause for separation within six months to the competent ecclesiastical authority which, after having investigated all the circumstances, is to consider carefully whether the innocent spouse can be moved to forgive the fault and not to prolong the separation permanently.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1153<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. If either of the spouses causes grave mental or physical danger to the other spouse or to the offspring or otherwise renders common life too difficult, that spouse gives the other a legitimate cause for leaving, either by decree of the local ordinary or even on his or her own authority if there is danger in delay.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. In all cases, when the cause for the separation ceases, conjugal living must be restored unless ecclesiastical authority has established otherwise.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1154 After the separation of the spouses has taken place, the adequate support and education of the children must always be suitably provided.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1155 The innocent spouse laudably can readmit the other spouse to conjugal life; in this case the innocent spouse renounces the right to separate.</p>

  <h5 id="CONVALIDATION">CHAPTER X. THE CONVALIDATION OF MARRIAGE</h5>

  <h6 id="SIMPLECONVAL">Art. 1. SIMPLE CONVALIDATION</h6>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1156<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. To convalidate a marriage which is invalid because of a diriment impediment, it is required that the impediment ceases or is dispensed and that at least the party conscious of the impediment renews consent.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Ecclesiastical law requires this renewal for the validity of the convalidation even if each party gave consent at the beginning and did not revoke it afterwards.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1157 The renewal of consent must be a new act of the will concerning a marriage which the renewing party knows or thinks was null from the beginning.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1158<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. If the impediment is public, both parties must renew the consent in canonical form, without prejudice to the prescript of can. 1127, §2.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. If the impediment cannot be proven, it is sufficient that the party conscious of the impediment renews the consent privately and in secret, provided that the other perseveres in the consent offered; if the impediment is known to both parties, both are to renew the consent.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1159<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A marriage which is invalid because of a defect of consent is convalidated if the party who did not consent now consents, provided that the consent given by the other party perseveres.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. If the defect of consent cannot be proven, it is sufficient that the party who did not consent gives consent privately and in secret.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. If the defect of consent can be proven, the consent must be given in canonical form.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1160 A marriage which is null because of defect of form must be contracted anew in canonical form in order to become valid, without prejudice to the prescript of can. 1127, §2.</p>

  <h6 id="RADICALSANATION">Art. 2. RADICAL SANATION</h6>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1161<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The radical sanation of an invalid marriage is its convalidation without the renewal of consent, which is granted by competent authority and entails the dispensation from an impediment, if there is one, and from canonical form, if it was not observed, and the retroactivity of canonical effects.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Convalidation occurs at the moment of the granting of the favor. Retroactivity, however, is understood to extend to the moment of the celebration of the marriage unless other provision is expressly made.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. A radical sanation is not to be granted unless it is probable that the parties wish to persevere in conjugal life.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1162<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A marriage cannot be radically sanated if consent is lacking in either or both of the parties, whether the consent was lacking from the beginning or, though present in the beginning, was revoked afterwards.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. If this consent was indeed lacking from the beginning but was given afterwards, the sanation can be granted from the moment the consent was given.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1163<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A marriage which is invalid because of an impediment or a defect of legitimate form can be sanated provided that the consent of each party perseveres.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. A marriage which is invalid because of an impediment of natural law or of divine positive law can be sanated only after the impediment has ceased.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1164 A sanation can be granted validly even if either or both of the parties do not know of it; nevertheless, it is not to be granted except for a grave cause.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1165<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The Apostolic See can grant a radical sanation.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The diocesan bishop can grant a radical sanation in individual cases even if there are several reasons for nullity in the same marriage, after the conditions mentioned in can. 1125 for the sanation of a mixed marriage have been ful-filled. He cannot grant one, however, if there is an impediment whose dispensation is reserved to the Apostolic See according to the norm of can. 1078, §2, or if it concerns an impediment of natural law or divine positive law which has now ceased.</p>
