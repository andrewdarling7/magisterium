  <h2>THE INTRODUCTORY RITES</h2>
  <h3>ENTRANCE CHANT</h3>
  <h6>When the people are gathered, the Priest approaches the altar with the ministers while the Entrance Chant is sung.</h6>
  <h6>When he has arrived at the altar, after making a profound bow with the ministers, the Priest venerates the altar with a kiss and, if appropriate, incenses the cross and the altar. Then, with the ministers, he goes to the chair.</h6>
  <h3>GREETING</h3>
  <h6>When the Entrance Chant is concluded, the Priest and the faithful, standing, sign themselves with the Sign of the Cross, while the Priest, facing the people, says:</h6>
  <p class="indent"><span class="red">Priest:</span> In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.</p>
  <p class="indent"><span class="red">People:</span> <b>Amen.</b></p>
  <h6>The priest welcomes us in the name of the Lord. We show our union with God, our neighbor, and the priest by a united response to his greeting.</h6>
  <h6>Then the Priest, extending his hands, greets the people, saying:</h6>

  <h6>The people reply:</h6>
  <p><span class="red">People:</span> <b>And with your spirit.</b></p>
  <h6>The Priest, or a Deacon, or another minister, may very briefly introduce the faithful to the Mass of the day.</h6>
  <h6>From time to time on Sundays, especially in Easter Time, instead of the customary Penitential Act, the blessing and sprinkling of water may take place as a reminder of Baptism.</h6>

  <h3 id="sprinklingrite">RITE FOR THE BLESSING AND SPRINKLING OF WATER <a href="#penitentialact" style="font-size: 11px;">(skip to Penitential Rite)</a></h3>
  <H6>On Sundays, especially in Easter Time, the blessing and sprinkling of water as a memorial of Baptism may take place from time to time in all churches and chapels, even in Masses anticipated on Saturday evenings.</H6>
  <h6>If this rite is celebrated during Mass, it takes the place of the usual Penitential Act at the beginning of Mass.</h6>
  <h6>After the greeting, the Priest stands at his chair and faces the people. With a vessel containing the water to be blessed before him, he calls upon the people to pray in these or similar words:</h6>
  <p>Dear brethren <span class="red">(</span>brothers and sisters<span class="red">)</span>,<br>let us humbly beseech the Lord our God<br>to bless this water he has created,<br>which will be sprinkled on us<br>as a memorial of our Baptism.<br>May he help us by his grace<br>to remain faithful to the Spirit we have received.</p>
  <h6>And after a brief pause for silence, he continues with hands joined:</h6>

  </div>

  <div id="Spr4" class="tabcontent">
    <h6>Where the circumstances of the place or the custom of the people suggest that the mixing of salt be preserved in the blessing of water, the Priest may bless salt saying,:</h6>
    <p>We humbly ask you, almighty God:<br>be pleased in your faithful love to bless <span class="red"><b>&#10016;</b></span> this salt<br>you have created,<br>for it was you who commanded the prophet Elisha<br>to cast salt into water,<br>that impure water might be purified.<br>Grant, O Lord, we pray,<br>that, wherever this mixture of salt and water is sprinkled,<br>every attack of the enemy may be repulsed<br>and your Holy Spirit may be present<br>to keep us safe at all times.<br>Through Christ our Lord.</p>
    <p> <span class="red"><b>R.</b></span> <b>Amen.</b></p>
    <h6>Then he pours the salt into the water, without saying anything.</h6>
  </div>
  <h6>Afterward, taking the aspergillum, the Priest sprinkles himself and the ministers, then the clergy and people, moving through the church, if appropriate.</h6>
  <h6>Meanwhile, one of the following chants, or another appropriate chant is sung.</h6>
