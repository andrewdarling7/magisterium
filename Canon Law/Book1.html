    <b><a href="Table-of-Contents.html">CODE OF CANON LAW</a></b>
  </h1>
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">BOOK I. GENERAL NORMS</h2>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 1 The canons of this Code regard only the Latin Church.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 2 For the most part the Code does not define the rites which must be observed in
    celebrating
    liturgical actions. Therefore, liturgical laws in force until now retain their force unless one of
    them is contrary to the canons of the Code.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 3 The canons of the Code neither abrogate nor derogate from the agreements entered
    into by
    the Apostolic See with nations or other political societies. These agreements therefore continue
    in force exactly as at present, notwithstanding contrary prescripts of this Code.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 4 Acquired rights and privileges granted to physical or juridic persons up to this
    time by
    the Apostolic See remain intact if they are in use and have not been revoked, unless the canons of
    this Code expressly revoke them.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 5 <br><span class="doubleindent">§</span>1. Universal or particular customs
    presently
    in force which are contrary to the
    prescripts of these canons and are reprobated by the canons of this Code are absolutely suppressed
    and are not permitted to revive in the future. Other contrary customs are also considered
    suppressed unless the Code expressly provides otherwise or unless they are centenary or immemorial
    customs which can be tolerated if, in the judgment of the ordinary, they cannot be removed due to
    the circumstances of places and persons.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Universal or particular customs beyond the law (<i>praeter ius</i>) which are
    in force until
    now are preserved.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 6 <br><span class="doubleindent">§</span>1. When this Code takes force, the
    following
    are abrogated:</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">1/</span> the Code of Canon Law promulgated in 1917;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">1/</span> other universal or particular laws contrary to the prescripts of this Code
    unless other
    provision is expressly made for particular laws;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">1/</span> any universal or particular penal laws whatsoever issued by the Apostolic See
    unless they are
    contained in this Code;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">1/</span> other universal disciplinary laws regarding matter which this Code completely
    reorders.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Insofar as they repeat former law, the canons of this Code must be assessed
    also in accord
    with canonical tradition.</p>
  <h4 id="1-1">TITLE I. ECCLESIASTICAL LAWS (Cann. 7 - 22)</h4>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 7 A law is established when it is promulgated.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 8<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Universal ecclesiastical laws are
    promulgated by publication in the official
    commentary, Acta
    Apostolicae Sedis, unless another manner of promulgation has been prescribed in particular cases. They take force
    only after three months have elapsed from the date of that issue of the Acta unless they bind immediately from the
    very nature of the matter, or the law itself has specifically and expressly established a shorter or longer
    suspensive period (<i>vacatio</i>).</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Particular laws are promulgated in the manner determined by the legislator
    and begin to oblige a month after
    the day of promulgation unless the law itself establishes another time period.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 9 Laws regard the future, not the past, unless they expressly provide for the
    past.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 10 Only those laws must be considered invalidating or disqualifying which
    expressly establish that an act is
    null or that a person is effected.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 11 Merely ecclesiastical laws bind those who have been baptized in the Catholic
    Church or received into it,
    possess the efficient use of reason, and, unless the law expressly provides otherwise, have completed seven years of
    age.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 12<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Universal laws bind everywhere all
    those for whom they were issued.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. All who are actually present in a certain
    territory, however, are exempted from universal laws which are not in
    force in that territory.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. Laws established for a particular territory bind those for whom they were
    issued as well as those who have a
    domicile or quasi-domicile there and who at the same time are actually residing there, without prejudice to the
    prescript of can. 13.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 13<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Particular laws are not presumed to
    be personal but territorial unless it
    is otherwise evident.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Travelers are not bound:</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">1/</span> by the particular laws of their own territory as long as they are absent from
    it unless either the transgression
    of those laws causes harm in their own territory or the laws are personal;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">2/</span> by the laws of the territory in which they are present, with the exception of
    those laws which provide for
    public order, which determine the formalities of acts, or which regard immovable goods located in the territory.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. Transients are bound by both universal and particular laws which are in force
    in the place where they are
    present.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 14 Laws, even invalidating and disqualifying ones, do not oblige when there is a
    doubt about the law. When
    there is a doubt about a fact, however, ordinaries can dispense from laws provided that, if it concerns a reserved
    dispensation, the authority to whom it is reserved usually grants it.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 15<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Ignorance or error about invalidating
    or disqualifying laws does not impede
    their effect unless it is
    expressly established otherwise.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Ignorance or error about a law, a penalty, a fact concerning oneself, or a
    notorious fact concerning another is
    not presumed; it is presumed about a fact concerning another which is not notorious until the contrary is proven.
  </p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 16<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The legislator authentically
    interprets laws as does the one to whom the
    same legislator has entrusted
    the power of authentically interpreting.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. An authentic interpretation put forth in the form of law has the same force
    as the law itself and must be
    promulgated. If it only declares the words of the law which are certain in themselves, it is retroactive; if it
    restricts or extends the law, or if it explains a doubtful law, it is not retroactive.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. An interpretation in the form of a judicial sentence or of an administrative
    act in a particular matter,
    however, does not have the force of law and only binds the persons for whom and affects the matters for which it was
    given.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 17 Ecclesiastical laws must be understood in accord with the proper meaning of the
    words considered in their
    text and context. If the meaning remains doubtful and obscure, recourse must be made to parallel places, if there
    are such, to the purpose and circumstances of the law, and to the mind of the legislator.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 18 Laws which establish a penalty, restrict the free exercise of rights, or
    contain an exception from the law
    are subject to strict interpretation.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 19 If a custom or an express prescript of universal or particular law is lacking
    in a certain matter, a case,
    unless it is penal, must be resolved in light of laws issued in similar matters, general principles of law applied
    with canonical equity, the jurisprudence and practice of the Roman Curia, and the common and constant opinion of
    learned persons.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 20 A later law abrogates, or derogates from, an earlier law if it states so
    expressly, is directly contrary to
    it, or completely reorders the entire matter of the earlier law. A universal law, however, in no way derogates from
    a particular or special law unless the law expressly provides otherwise.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 21 In a case of doubt, the revocation of a pre-existing law is not presumed, but
    later laws must be related to
    the earlier ones and, insofar as possible, must be harmonized with them.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 22 Civil laws to which the law of the Church yields are to be observed in canon
    law with the same effects,
    insofar as they are not contrary to divine law and unless canon law provides otherwise.</p>

  <h4 id="1-2">TITLE II. CUSTOM (Cann. 23 - 28)</h4>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 23 Only that custom introduced by a community of the faithful and approved by the
    legislator according to the norm of the following canons has the force of law.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 24<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. No custom which is contrary to divine
    law can obtain the force of law.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. A custom contrary to or beyond canon law (<i>praeter ius canonicum</i>)
    cannot obtain the force of law unless it is reasonable; a custom which is expressly reprobated in the law, however,
    is not reasonable.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 25 No custom obtains the force of law unless it has been observed with the
    intention of introducing a law by a community capable at least of receiving law.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 26 Unless the competent legislator has specifically approved it, a custom contrary
    to the canon law now in force or one beyond a canonical law (<i>praeter legem canonicam</i>) obtains the force of
    law only if it has been legitimately observed for thirty continuous and complete years. Only a centenary or
    immemorial custom, however, can prevail against a canonical law which contains a clause prohibiting future customs.
  </p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 27 Custom is the best interpreter of laws.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 28 Without prejudice to the prescript of can. 5, a contrary custom or law revokes
    a custom which is contrary to or beyond the law (<i>praeter legem</i>). Unless it makes express mention of them,
    however, a law does not revoke centenary or immemorial customs, nor does a universal law revoke particular customs.
  </p>

  <h4 id="1-3">TITLE III. GENERAL DECREES AND INSTRUCTIONS (Cann. 29 - 34)</h4>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 29 General decrees, by which a competent legislator issues common prescripts for a
    community capable of receiving law, are laws properly speaking and are governed by the prescripts of the canons on
    laws.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 30 A person who possesses only executive power is not able to issue the general
    decree mentioned in&nbsp;can. 29 unless, in particular cases, it has been expressly granted to that person by a
    competent legislator according to the norm of law and the conditions stated in the act of the grant have been
    observed.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 31<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Those who possess executive power are
    able to issue, within the limits of their competence, general executory decrees, namely, those which more precisely
    determine the methods to be observed in applying the law or which urge the observance of laws.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. With respect to the promulgation and suspensive period (<i>vacatio</i>) of
    the decrees mentioned in §1, the prescripts of&nbsp;can. 8 are to be observed.
  </p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 32 General executory decrees oblige those who are bound by the laws whose methods
    of application the same decrees determine or whose observance they urge.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 33<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. General executory decrees, even if
    they are issued in directories or in documents of another name, do not derogate from laws, and their prescripts
    which are contrary to laws lack all force.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Such decrees cease to have force by explicit or implicit revocation made by
    competent authority as well as by cessation of the law for whose execution they were given. They do not, however,
    cease when the authority of the one who established them expires unless the contrary is expressly provided.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 34<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Instructions clarify the prescripts
    of laws and elaborate on and determine the methods to be observed in fulfilling them. They are given for the use of
    those whose duty it is to see that laws are executed and oblige them in the execution of the laws. Those who possess
    executive power legitimately issue such instructions within the limits of their competence.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The ordinances of instructions do not derogate from laws. If these ordinances
    cannot be reconciled with the prescripts of laws, they lack all force.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. Instructions cease to have force not only by explicit or implicit revocation
    of the competent authority who issued them or of the superior of that authority but also by the cessation of the law
    for whose clarification or execution they were given.</p>


  <h4 id="1-4">TITLE IV. SINGULAR ADMINISTRATIVE ACTS (Cann. 35 - 93)</h4>
  <h5 id="4CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I. COMMON NORMS</h5>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 35 A singular administrative act, whether it is a decree, a precept, or a
    rescript, can be issued by one who possesses executive power within the limits of that person’s competence, without
    prejudice to the prescript of&nbsp;can. 76, §1.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 36<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. An administrative act must be
    understood according to the proper meaning of the words and the common manner of speaking. In a case of doubt, those
    which refer to litigation, pertain to threatening or inflicting penalties, restrict the rights of a person, injure
    the acquired rights of others, or are contrary to a law which benefits private persons are subject to a strict
    interpretation; all others are subject to a broad interpretation.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. An administrative act must not be extended to other cases besides those
    expressed.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 37 An administrative act which regards the external forum must be put in writing.
  </p>
  <p>Furthermore, if it is given in commissariat form, the act of its execution must be put in writing.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 38 An administrative act, even if it is a rescript given motu proprio, lacks
    effect insofar as it injures the acquired right of another or is contrary to a law or approved custom, unless the
    competent authority has expressly added a derogating clause.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 39 Conditions in an administrative act are considered added for validity only when
    they are expressed by the particles if (<i>si</i>), unless (<i>nisi</i>), or provided that (<i>dummodo</i>).</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 40 The executor of any administrative act invalidly carries out his or her
    function before receiving the relevant letter and verifying its authenticity and integrity, unless previous notice
    of the letter had been communicated to the executor by authority of the one who issued the act.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 41 The executor of an administrative act to whom is entrusted merely the task of
    execution cannot refuse the execution of this act unless it clearly appears that the act itself is null or cannot be
    upheld for another grave cause, or the conditions attached to the administrative act itself have not been fulfilled.
    Nevertheless, if the execution of the administrative act seems inopportune due to the circumstances of person or
    place, the executor is to suspend the execution. In such cases the executor is to inform immediately the authority
    who issued the act.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 42 The executor of an administrative act must proceed according to the norm of the
    mandate. If, however, the executor did not fulfill the essential conditions attached to the relevant letter and did
    not observe the substantial form of proceeding, the execution is invalid.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 43 The executor of an administrative act can, according to his or her prudent
    judgment, substitute another as executor unless substitution has been forbidden, the executor has been chosen for
    personal qualifications, or a substitute has been predetermined. In these cases, however, the executor may entrust
    the preparatory acts to another.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 44 The executor’s successor in office can also execute an administrative act
    unless the executor was chosen for personal qualifications.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 45 If the executor has erred in any way in the execution of an administrative act,
    the executor is permitted to execute the same act again.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 46 An administrative act does not cease when the authority of the one who
    established it expires unless the law expressly provides otherwise.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 47 The revocation of an administrative act by another administrative act of a
    competent authority takes effect only from the moment at which the revocation is legitimately made known to the
    person for whom it has been given.</p>
  <h5 id="4CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II SINGULAR DECREES AND PRECEPTS</h5>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 48 A singular decree is an administrative act issued by a competent executive
    authority in which a decision is given or a provision is made for a particular case according to the norms of law.
    Of their nature, these decisions or provisions do not presuppose a petition made by someone.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 49 A singular precept is a decree which directly and legitimately enjoins a
    specific person or persons to do or omit something, especially in order to urge the observance of law.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 50 Before issuing a singular decree, an authority is to seek out the necessary
    information and proofs and, insofar as possible, to hear those whose rights can be injured.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 51 A decree is to be issued in writing, with the reasons at least summarily
    expressed if it is a decision.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 52 A singular decree has force only in respect to the matters which it decides and
    for the persons for whom it was given. It obliges these persons everywhere, however, unless it is otherwise evident.
  </p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 53 If decrees are contrary to one another, a particular decree prevails over a
    general in those matters which are specifically expressed. If they are equally particular or equally general, the
    decree later in time modifies the earlier to the extent that the later one is contrary to it.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 54<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A singular decree whose application
    is entrusted to an executor takes effect from the moment of execution; otherwise, from the moment it is made known
    to the person by the authority of the one who issued it.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. To be enforced, a singular decree must be made known by a legitimate document
    according to the norm of law.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 55 Without prejudice to the prescripts of cann.&nbsp;37 and&nbsp;51, when a very
    grave reason prevents the handing over of the written text of a decree, the decree is considered to have been made
    known if it is read to the person to whom it is destined in the presence of a notary or two witnesses. After a
    written record of what has occurred has been prepared, all those present must sign it.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 56 A decree is considered to have been made known if the one for whom it is
    destined has been properly summoned to receive or hear the decree but, without a just cause, did not appear or
    refused to sign.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 57<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Whenever the law orders a decree to
    be issued or an interested party legitimately proposes a petition or recourse to obtain a decree, the competent
    authority is to provide for the matter within three months from the receipt of the petition or recourse unless the
    law prescribes some other time period.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. When this time period has passed, if the decree has not yet been given, the
    response is presumed to be negative with respect to the presentation of further recourse.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. A presumed negative response does not exempt the competent authority from the
    obligation of issuing the decree and even of repairing the damage possibly incurred, according to the norm
    of&nbsp;can. 128.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 58<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A singular decree ceases to have
    force through legitimate revocation by competent authority as well as through cessation of the law for whose
    execution it was given.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. A singular precept not imposed by a legitimate document ceases when the
    authority of the one who issued it expires.</p>
  <h5 id="4CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III. RESCRIPTS</h5>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 59<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A rescript is an administrative act
    issued in writing by competent executive authority; of its very nature, a rescript grants a privilege, dispensation,
    or other favor at someone’s request.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The prescripts established for rescripts are valid also for the oral granting
    of a permission or favors unless it is otherwise evident.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 60 Any rescript can be requested by all those who are not expressly prohibited
    from doing so.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 61 Unless it is otherwise evident, a rescript can be requested for another even
    without the person’s assent and has force before the person’s acceptance, without prejudice to contrary clauses.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 62 A rescript in which no executor is given has effect at the moment the letter is
    given; other rescripts, at the moment of execution.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 63<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Subreption, or concealment of the
    truth, prevents the validity of a rescript if in the request those things were not expressed which according to law,
    style, and canonical practice must be expressed for validity, unless it is a rescript of favor which is given motu
    proprio.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Obreption, or a statement of falsehood, also prevents the validity of a
    rescript if not even one proposed motivating reason is true.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. The motivating reason in rescripts for which there is no executor must be
    true at the time when the rescript is given; in others, at the time of execution.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 64 Without prejudice to the authority of the Penitentiary for the internal forum,
    a favor denied by any dicastery of the Roman Curia cannot be granted validly by any other dicastery of the same
    Curia or by another competent authority below the Roman Pontiff without the assent of the dicastery before which the
    matter was initiated.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 65<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Without prejudice to the prescripts
    of §2 and 3, no one is to petition from another ordinary a favor denied by one’s own ordinary unless mention of the
    denial has been made. When this mention has been made, however, the ordinary is not to grant the favor unless he has
    obtained the reasons for the denial from the prior ordinary.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. A favor denied by a vicar general or by an episcopal vicar cannot be granted
    validly by another vicar of the same bishop even if the reasons for the denial have been obtained from the vicar who
    denied it.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. A favor denied by a vicar general or by an episcopal vicar and afterwards
    obtained from the diocesan bishop without any mention made of this denial is invalid. A favor denied by a diocesan
    bishop, however, even if mention is made of the denial, cannot be obtained validly from his vicar general or
    episcopal vicar without the consent of the bishop.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 66 A rescript does not become invalid due to an error in the name of the person to
    whom it is given or by whom it is issued, or of the place where the person resides, or in the matter concerned,
    provided that, in the judgment of the ordinary, there is no doubt about the person or the matter.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 67<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. If it happens that two contrary
    rescripts are obtained for one and the same thing, the particular prevails over the general in those matters which
    are particularly expressed.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. If they are equally particular or equally general, the earlier in time
    prevails over the later unless there is express mention of the earlier one in the later one or unless the person who
    obtained the earlier one has not used the rescript out of malice or notable negligence.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. In a case of doubt whether a rescript is invalid or not, recourse is to be
    made to the one who issued it.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 68 A rescript of the Apostolic See in which no executor is given must be presented
    to the ordinary of the one who obtained it only when it is prescribed in the same letter, or it concerns public
    matters, or it is necessary that conditions be verified.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 69 A rescript for whose presentation no time is specified can be shown to the
    executor at any time, provided that there is neither fraud nor malice.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 70 If in a rescript the granting of a favor is entrusted to an executor, it is up
    to the prudent judgment and conscience of the executor to grant or deny the favor.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 71 No one is bound to use a rescript given only in his or her favor unless bound
    to do so by a canonical obligation from another source.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 72 Rescripts granted by the Apostolic See which have expired can be extended once
    by the diocesan bishop for a just cause, but not beyond three months.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 73 Rescripts are not revoked by a contrary law unless the law itself provides
    otherwise.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 74 Although one can use in the internal forum a favor granted orally, the person
    is bound to prove the favor in the external forum whenever someone legitimately requests it.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 75 If a rescript contains a privilege or dispensation, the prescripts of the
    following canons are also to be observed.</p>
  <h5 id="4CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV. PRIVILEGES</h5>

    however, an ordinary is bound to notify the Apostolic See.</p>
  <h5 id="4CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V. DISPENSATIONS</h5>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 85 A dispensation, or the relaxation of a merely ecclesiastical law in a
    particular case, can be granted by those who possess executive power within the limits of their competence, as well
    as by those who have the power to dispense explicitly or implicitly either by the law itself or by legitimate
    delegation.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 86 Laws are not subject to dispensation to the extent that they define those
    things which are essentially constitutive of juridic institutes or acts.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 87<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A diocesan bishop, whenever he judges
    that it contributes to their spiritual good, is able to dispense the faithful from universal and particular
    disciplinary laws issued for his territory or his subjects by the supreme authority of the Church. He is not able to
    dispense, however, from procedural or penal laws nor from those whose dispensation is specially reserved to the
    Apostolic See or some other authority.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. If recourse to the Holy See is difficult and, at the same time, there is
    danger of grave harm in delay, any ordinary is able to dispense from these same laws even if dispensation is
    reserved to the Holy See, provided that it concerns a dispensation which the Holy See is accustomed to grant under
    the same circumstances, without prejudice to the prescript of&nbsp;can. 291.</p>

    conference of bishops.</p>

    universal and particular law unless this power has been expressly granted to them.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 90<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. One is not to be dispensed from an
    ecclesiastical law without a just and reasonable cause, after taking into account the circumstances of the case and
    the gravity of the law from which dispensation is given; otherwise the dispensation is illicit and, unless it is
    given by the legislator himself or his superior, also invalid.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. In a case of doubt concerning the sufficiency of the cause, a dispensation is

    able to exercise it with respect to his subjects even though they are absent from the territory, and, unless the
    contrary is expressly established, also with respect to travelers actually present in the territory, as well as with
    respect to himself.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 92 A dispensation is subject to a strict interpretation according to the norm

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 97<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A person who has completed the
    eighteenth year of age has reached majority; below this age, a person is

    quasi-domicile, that of the mother.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. In the case of a child of transients, the place of origin is the actual place

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 113<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The Catholic Church and the
    Apostolic See have the character of a moral person by divine ordinance

    which transcends the purpose of the individuals.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The purposes mentioned in §1 are
    understood as those which pertain to works of piety, of the apostolate, or of

    the prior ones and assumes the obligations with which they were burdened. With regard to the allocation of goods in

    patrimonial rights, and
    obligations is governed by law and its statutes; if these give no indication, they go to the juridic person
    immediately superior, always without prejudice to the intention of the founders and donors and acquired rights. Upon
    the extinction of a private juridic person, the allocation of its goods and obligations is governed by its own

    law, for the power of governance, which exists in the Church by divine institution and is also called the power of
    jurisdiction.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Lay members of the Christian faithful can cooperate in the exercise of this
    same power according to the norm of
    law.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 130 Of itself, the power of governance is exercised for the external forum;
    sometimes, however, it is
    exercised for the internal forum alone, so that the effects which its exercise is meant to have for the external
    forum are not recognized there, except insofar as the law establishes it in determined cases.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 131 <br><span class="doubleindent">§</span>1. The ordinary power of governance is
    that which is joined to a certain
    office by the law itself;
    delegated, that which is granted to a person but not by means of an office.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The ordinary power of governance can be either proper or vicarious.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. The burden of proving delegation rests on the one who claims to have been
    delegated.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 132 <br><span class="doubleindent">§</span>1. Habitual faculties are governed by
    the prescripts for delegated power.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Nevertheless, unless the grant expressly provides otherwise or the ordinary
    was chosen for personal
    qualifications, a habitual faculty granted to an ordinary is not withdrawn when the authority of the ordinary to
    whom it was granted expires, even if he has begun to execute it, but the faculty transfers to any ordinary who
    succeeds him in governance.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 133 <br><span class="doubleindent">§</span>1. A delegate who exceeds the limits of
    the mandate with respect to either
    matters or persons does not
    act at all.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. A delegate who carries out those things for which the person was delegated in
    some manner other than that
    determined in the mandate is not considered to exceed the limits of the mandate unless the manner was prescribed for
    validity by the one delegating.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 134 <br><span class="doubleindent">§</span>1. In addition to the Roman Pontiff, by
    the title of ordinary are understood
    in the law diocesan bishops
    and others who, even if only temporarily, are placed over some particular church or a community equivalent to it
    according to the norm of&nbsp;can. 368 as well as those who possess general ordinary executive power in them,
    namely, vicars general and episcopal vicars; likewise, for their own members, major superiors of clerical religious
    institutes of pontifical right and of clerical societies of apostolic life of pontifical right who at least possess
    ordinary executive power.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. By the title of local ordinary are understood all those mentioned in §1
    except the superiors of religious
    institutes and of societies of apostolic life.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. Within the context of executive power, those things which in the canons are
    attributed by name to the diocesan
    bishop are understood to belong only to a diocesan bishop and to the others made equivalent to him in&nbsp;can. 381,
    §2, excluding the vicar general and episcopal vicar except by special mandate.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 135 <br><span class="doubleindent">§</span>1. The power of governance is
    distinguished as legislative, executive, and
    judicial.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Legislative power must be exercised in the manner prescribed by law; that
    which a legislator below the supreme
    authority possesses in the Church cannot be validly delegated unless the law explicitly provides otherwise. A lower
    legislator cannot validly issue a law contrary to higher law.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. Judicial power, which judges or judicial colleges possess, must be exercised
    in the manner prescribed by law
    and cannot be delegated except to perform acts preparatory to some decree or sentence.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>4. In what pertains to the exercise of executive power, the prescripts of the
    following canons are to be observed.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 136 Unless the nature of the matter or a prescript of law establishes otherwise, a
    person is able to exercise
    executive power over his subjects, even when he or they are outside his territory; he is also able to exercise this
    power over travelers actually present in the territory if it concerns granting favors or executing universal laws or
    particular laws which bind them according to the norm of&nbsp;can. 13, §2, n. 2.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 137 <br><span class="doubleindent">§</span>1. Ordinary executive power can be
    delegated both for a single act and for
    all cases unless the law
    expressly provides otherwise.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Executive power delegated by the Apostolic See can be subdelegated for a
    single act or for all cases unless the
    delegate was chosen for personal qualifications or subdelegation was expressly forbidden.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. Executive power delegated by another authority who has ordinary power can be
    subdelegated only for individual
    cases if it was delegated for all cases. If it was delegated for a single act or for determined acts, however, it
    cannot be subdelegated except by express grant of the one delegating.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>4. No subdelegated power can be subdelegated again unless the one delegating has
    expressly granted this.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 138 Ordinary executive power as well as power delegated for all cases must be
    interpreted broadly; any other,
    however, must be interpreted strictly. Nevertheless, one who has delegated power is understood to have been granted
    also those things without which the delegate cannot exercise this power.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 139 <br><span class="doubleindent">§</span>1. Unless the law determines otherwise,
    the fact that a person approaches
    some competent authority, even
    a higher one, does not suspend the executive power, whether ordinary or delegated, of another competent authority.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Nevertheless, a lower authority is not to become involved in cases submitted
    to a higher authority except for a
    grave and urgent cause; in this case, the lower authority is immediately to notify the higher concerning the matter.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 140 <br><span class="doubleindent">§</span>1. When several persons have been
    delegated in solidum to transact the same
    affair, the one who first
    begins to deal with it excludes the others from doing so unless that person subsequently was impeded or did not wish
    to proceed further in carrying it out.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. When several persons have been delegated collegially to transact an affair,
    all must proceed according to the
    norm of&nbsp;can. 119 unless the mandate has provided otherwise.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. Executive power delegated to several persons is presumed to be delegated to
    them in solidum.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 141 When several persons have been delegated successively, that person is to take
    care of the affair whose
    mandate is the earlier and has not been subsequently revoked.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 142 <br><span class="doubleindent">§</span>1. Delegated power ceases: by
    fulfillment of the mandate; by expiration of
    the time or completion of the
    number of cases for which it was granted; by cessation of the purpose for the delegation; by revocation of the one
    delegating directly communicated to the delegate as well as by resignation of the delegate made known to and
    accepted by the one delegating. It does not cease, however, when the authority of the one delegating expires unless
    this appears in attached clauses.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Nevertheless, an act of delegated power which is exercised for the internal
    forum alone and is placed
    inadvertently after the lapse of the time limit of the grant is valid.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 143 <br><span class="doubleindent">§</span>1. Ordinary power ceases by loss of the
    office to which it is connected.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Unless the law provides otherwise, ordinary power is suspended if,
    legitimately, an appeal is made or a
    recourse is lodged against privation of or removal from office.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 144 <br><span class="doubleindent">§</span>1. In factual or legal common error and
    in positive and probable doubt of law
    or of fact, the Church
    supplies executive power of governance for both the external and internal forum.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The same norm is applied to the faculties mentioned in
    cann.&nbsp;882,&nbsp;883,&nbsp;966, and&nbsp;1111, §1.</p>

  <h4 id="1-9">TITLE IX. ECCLESIASTICAL OFFICES (Cann. 145 - 196)</h4>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 145 <br><span class="doubleindent">§</span>1. An ecclesiastical office is any
    function constituted in a stable manner by
    divine or ecclesiastical
    ordinance to be exercised for a spiritual purpose.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The obligations and rights proper to individual ecclesiastical offices are
    defined either in the law by which
    the office is constituted or in the decree of the competent authority by which the office is at the same time
    constituted and conferred.</p>
  <h5 id="9CHAPTER_I.">CHAPTER I. PROVISION OF ECCLESIASTICAL OFFICE</h5>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 146 An ecclesiastical office cannot be acquired validly without canonical
    provision.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 147 The provision of an ecclesiastical office is made: through free conferral by a
    competent ecclesiastical
    authority; through installation by the same authority if presentation preceded it; through confirmation or admission
    granted by the same authority if election or postulation preceded it; finally, through simple election and
    acceptance by the one elected if the election does not require confirmation.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 148 The provision of offices is also the competence of the authority to whom it
    belongs to erect, change, and
    suppress them unless the law establishes otherwise.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 149 <br><span class="doubleindent">§</span>1. To be promoted to an ecclesiastical
    office, a person must be in the
    communion of the Church as well as
    suitable, that is, endowed with those qualities which are required for that office by universal or particular law or
    by the law of the foundation.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Provision of an ecclesiastical office made to one who lacks the requisite
    qualities is invalid only if the
    qualities are expressly required for the validity of the provision by universal or particular law or by the law of
    the foundation. Otherwise it is valid but can be rescinded by decree of competent authority or by sentence of an
    administrative tribunal.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. Provision of an office made as a result of simony is invalid by the law
    itself.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 150 An office which entails the full care of souls and for whose fulfillment the
    exercise of the priestly
    order is required cannot be conferred validly on one who is not yet a priest.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 151 The provision of an office which entails the care of souls is not to be
    deferred without a grave cause.
  </p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 152 Two or more incompatible offices, that is, offices which together cannot be
    fulfilled at the same time by
    the same person, are not to be conferred upon one person.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 153 <br><span class="doubleindent">§</span>1. The provision of an office which by
    law is not vacant is by that fact
    invalid and is not validated by
    subsequent vacancy.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Nevertheless, if it concerns an office which by law is conferred for a
    determined period of time, provision can
    be made within six months before the expiration of this time and takes effect from the day of the vacancy of the
    office.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. A promise of some office, no matter by whom it is made, produces no juridic
    effect.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 154 An office vacant by law, which may still be possessed illegitimately by
    someone, can be conferred provided
    that it has been declared properly that the possession is not legitimate and mention of this declaration is made in
    the letter of conferral.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 155 A person who confers an office in the place of another who is negligent or
    impeded acquires no power
    thereafter over the person upon whom the office was conferred. The juridic condition of that person, however, is
    established just as if the provision had been completed according to the ordinary norm of law.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 156 The provision of any office is to be put in writing.</p>
  <h6 id="Art._1.">Art. 1. FREE CONFERRAL</h6>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 157 Unless the law explicitly establishes otherwise, it is for the diocesan bishop
    to provide for
    ecclesiastical offices in his own particular church by free conferral.</p>
  <h6 id="Art._2.">Art. 2. PRESENTATION</h6>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 158 <br><span class="doubleindent">§</span>1. Presentation for an ecclesiastical
    office by a person who has the right of
    presentation must be made
    to the authority to whom it belongs to install in that office. Moreover, this must be done within three months from
    notice of the vacancy of the office unless other provision has been made legitimately.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. If some college or group of persons has the right of presentation, the person
    to be presented is to be
    designated according to the prescripts of&nbsp;cann. 165-179.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 159 No one is to be presented unwillingly; therefore, a person who is proposed for
    presentation and questioned
    about his or her intention can be presented unless the person declines within eight useful days.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 160 <br><span class="doubleindent">§</span>1. The person who possesses the right
    of presentation can present one or even
    several persons, either at
    the same time or successively.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. No one can present oneself; a college or group of persons, however, can
    present one of its own members.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 161 <br><span class="doubleindent">§</span>1. Unless the law establishes
    otherwise, a person who has presented one found
    unsuitable can present
    another candidate within a month, but once more only.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. If the person presented renounces or dies before the installation, the one
    who has the right of presentation
    can exercise this right again within a month from the notice of the renunciation or death.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 162 A person who has not made presentation within the useful time according to the
    norm of&nbsp;can. 158, §1
    and&nbsp;can. 161 as well as one who has twice presented an unsuitable person loses the right of presentation for
    that case. The authority to whom it belongs to install freely provides for the vacant office, with the assent,
    however, of the proper ordinary of the person appointed.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 163 The authority competent to install the person presented according to the norm
    of law is to install the one
    legitimately presented whom the authority has found suitable and who has accepted. If several persons legitimately
    presented have been found suitable, the authority must install one of them.</p>
  <h6 id="Art._3.">Art. 3. ELECTION</h6>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 164 Unless the law has provided otherwise, the prescripts of the following canons
    are to be observed in
    canonical elections.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 165 Unless the law or the legitimate statutes of a college or group have provided
    otherwise, if a college or
    group of persons has the right of election to office, the election is not to be delayed beyond three months of
    useful time computed from the notice of the vacancy of the office. If this limit has passed without action, the
    ecclesiastical authority who has the right of confirming the election or the right of providing for the office
    successively is to make provision freely for the vacant office.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 166<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The person presiding over a college
    or group is to convoke all those
    belonging to the college or
    group; the notice of convocation, however, when it must be personal, is valid if it is given in the place of
    domicile or quasi-domicile or in the place of residence.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. If anyone of those to be convoked was overlooked and for that reason was
    absent, the election is valid.
    Nevertheless, at the instance of that same person and when the oversight and absence have been proved, the election
    must be rescinded by the competent authority even if it has been confirmed, provided that it is evident juridically
    that recourse had been made at least within three days from the notice of the election.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. If more than one-third of the electors were overlooked, however, the election
    is null by the law itself unless
    all those overlooked were in fact present.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 167<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. When the notice of the convocation
    has been given legitimately, those
    present on the day and at the
    place determined in the same notice have the right to vote. The faculty of voting by letter or proxy is excluded
    unless the statutes legitimately provide otherwise.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. If one of the electors is present in the house where the election occurs but
    cannot be present at the election
    due to ill health, his or her written vote is to be sought by the tellers.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 168 Even if a person has the right to vote in his or her own name under several
    titles, the person can vote
    only once.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 169 For an election to be valid, no one can be admitted to vote who does not
    belong to the college or group.
  </p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 170 An election whose freedom actually has been impeded in any way is invalid by
    the law itself.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 171<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The following are effected to vote:
  </p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">1/</span> a person incapable of a human act;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">2/</span> a person who lacks active voice;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">3/</span> a person under a penalty of excommunication whether through a judicial
    sentence or through a decree by which a
    penalty is imposed or declared;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">4/</span> a person who has defected notoriously from the communion of the Church.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. If one of the above is admitted, the person’s vote is null, but the election
    is valid unless it is evident
    that, with that vote subtracted, the one elected did not receive the required number of votes.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 172<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. To be valid, a vote must be:</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">1/</span> free; therefore the vote of a person who has been coerced directly or
    indirectly by grave fear or malice to vote
    for a certain person or different persons separately is invalid;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">2/</span> secret, certain, absolute, determined.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Conditions attached to a vote before the election are to be considered as not
    having been added.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 173<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Before an election begins, at least
    two tellers are to be designated from
    the membership of the
    college or group.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The tellers are to collect the votes, to examine in the presence of the one
    presiding over the election whether
    the number of ballots corresponds to the number of electors, to count the votes themselves, and to announce openly
    how many votes each person has received.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. If the number of votes exceeds the number of electors, the voting is without
    effect.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>4. All the acts of an election are to be transcribed accurately by the secretary
    and are to be preserved carefully
    in the archive of the college after they have been signed at least by the same secretary, the one presiding, and the
    tellers.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 174<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Unless the law or the statutes
    provide otherwise, an election can also be
    done by compromise, provided
    that the electors, by unanimous and written consent, transfer the right to elect on that occasion to one or more
    suitable persons, whether from among the membership or outside it, who are to elect in the name of all by virtue of
    the faculty received.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. If it concerns a college or group composed of clerics alone, those
    commissioned must be ordained; otherwise the
    election is invalid.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. Those commissioned must observe the prescripts of the law concerning
    elections and, for the validity of the
    election, the conditions attached to the compromise agreement which are not contrary to the law; conditions contrary
    to the law, however, are to be considered as not having been attached.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 175 The compromise ceases and the right to vote returns to those authorizing the
    compromise:</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">1/</span> by revocation by the college or group before any action was taken;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">2/</span> if some condition attached to the compromise agreement was not fulfilled;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">3/</span> if the election had been completed but was null.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 176 Unless the law or the statutes provide otherwise, the person who has received
    the required number of votes
    according to the norm of&nbsp;can. 119, n. 1 is considered elected and is to be announced as such by the one
    presiding over the college or group.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 177<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. An election must be communicated
    immediately to the person elected who
    must inform the one presiding
    over the college or group whether or not he or she accepts the election within eight useful days after receiving the
    notification; otherwise, the election has no effect.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. If the one elected has not accepted, the person loses every right deriving
    from the election and does not
    regain any right by subsequent acceptance but can be elected again. A college or group, however, must proceed to a
    new election within a month from notifcation of non-acceptance.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 178 The person elected who has accepted an election which does not need
    confirmation obtains the office in
    full right immediately; otherwise, the person acquires only the right to the office.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 179<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. If the election requires
    confirmation, the person elected must personally
    or through another seek
    confirmation from the competent authority within eight useful days from the day of acceptance of election;
    otherwise, the person is deprived of every right unless it has been proved that the person was prevented from
    seeking confirmation by a just impediment.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The competent authority cannot deny confirmation if the person elected has
    been found suitable according to the
    norm of can. 149, §1, and the election was conducted according to the norm of law.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. Confirmation must be given in writing.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>4. Before being notified of confirmation, the person elected is not permitted to
    become involved in the
    administration of the office, whether in matters spiritual or temporal, and acts possibly placed by the person are
    null.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>5. Once notified of the confirmation, the one elected obtains the office in full
    right unless the law provides
    otherwise.</p>
  <h6 id="Art._4.">Art. 4. POSTULATION</h6>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 180<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. If a canonical impediment from which
    a dispensation can be and customarily
    is granted prevents the
    election of a person whom the electors believe to be more suitable and whom they prefer, by their votes they can
    postulate that person from the competent authority unless the law provides otherwise.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Those commissioned to elect in virtue of a compromise cannot postulate unless
    this was expressed in the
    compromise.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 181<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. At least two-thirds of the votes are
    required for a postulation to have
    force.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. A vote for postulation must be expressed by the words, I postulate, or the
    equivalent. The formula, I elect or
    I postulate, or the equivalent is valid for election if there is no impediment; otherwise it is valid for
    postulation.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 182<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A postulation must be sent within
    eight useful days by the one presiding
    to the authority competent to
    confirm the election, to whom it pertains to grant the dispensation from the impediment, or, if the authority does
    not have this power, to petition the dispensation from a higher authority. If confirmation is not required, a
    postulation must be sent to the authority competent to grant the dispensation.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. If a postulation has not been sent within the prescribed time, by that fact
    it is null, and the college or
    group is deprived of the right of electing or postulating for that occasion unless it is proved that the one
    presiding had been prevented from sending the postulation by a just impediment or had refrained from sending it at
    the opportune time by malice or negligence.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. The person postulated acquires no right by postulation; the competent
    authority is not obliged to admit the
    postulation.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>4. Electors cannot revoke a postulation made to a competent authority unless the
    authority consents.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 183<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. If a postulation has not been
