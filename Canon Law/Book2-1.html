  <h2 style="text-align: center;">BOOK II. THE PEOPLE OF GOD</h2>
  <h2 id="2-1">PART I. THE CHRISTIAN FAITHFUL (Cann. 204 - 207)</h2>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 204<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The Christian faithful are those who, inasmuch as they have been incorporated in Christ through baptism, have been constituted as the people of God. For this reason, made sharers in their own way in Christ’s priestly, prophetic, and royal function, they are called to exercise the mission which God has entrusted to the Church to fulfill in the world, in accord with the condition proper to each.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. This Church, constituted and organized in this world as a society, subsists in the Catholic Church governed by the successor of Peter and the bishops in communion with him.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 205 Those baptized are fully in the communion of the Catholic Church on this earth who are joined with Christ in its visible structure by the bonds of the profession of faith, the sacraments, and ecclesiastical governance.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 206<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Catechumens, that is, those who ask by explicit choice under the influence of the Holy Spirit to be incorporated into the Church, are joined to it in a special way. By this same desire, just as by the life of faith, hope, and charity which they lead, they are united with the Church which already cherishes them as its own.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The Church has a special care for catechumens; while it invites them to lead a life of the gospel and introduces them to the celebration of sacred rites, it already grants them various prerogatives which are proper to Christians.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 207<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. By divine institution, there are among the Christian faithful in the Church sacred ministers who in law are also called clerics; the other members of the Christian faithful are called lay persons.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. There are members of the Christian faithful from both these groups who, through the profession of the evangelical counsels by means of vows or other sacred bonds recognized and sanctioned by the Church, are consecrated to God in their own special way and contribute to the salvific mission of the Church; although their state does not belong to the hierarchical structure of the Church, it nevertheless belongs to its life and holiness.</p>
  <h4 id="2-1TITLE_I">TITLE I. THE OBLIGATIONS AND RIGHTS OF ALL THE CHRISTIAN FAITHFUL (Cann. 208 - 223)</h4>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 208 From their rebirth in Christ, there exists among all the Christian faithful a true equality regarding dignity and action by which they all cooperate in the building up of the Body of Christ according to each one’s own condition and function.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 209<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The Christian faithful, even in their own manner of acting, are always obliged to maintain communion with the Church.</p>

  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3.

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 213 The Christian faithful have the right to receive assistance from the sacred pastors out of the spiritual goods of the Church, especially the word of God and the sacraments.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 214 The Christian faithful have the right to worship God according to the prescripts of their own rite approved by the legitimate pastors of the Church and to follow their own form of spiritual life so long as it is consonant with the doctrine of the Church.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 215 The Christian faithful are at liberty freely to found and direct associations for purposes of charity or piety or for the promotion of the Christian vocation in the world and to hold meetings for the common pursuit of these purposes.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 216 Since they participate in the mission of the Church, all the Christian faithful have the right to promote or sustain apostolic action even by their own undertakings, according to their own state and condition. Nevertheless, no undertaking is to claim the name Catholic without the consent of competent ecclesiastical authority.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 217 Since they are called by baptism to lead a life in keeping with the teaching of the gospel, the Christian faithful have the right to a Christian education by which they are to be instructed properly to strive for the maturity of the human person and at the same time to know and live the mystery of salvation.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 218 Those engaged in the sacred disciplines have a just freedom of inquiry and of expressing their opinion prudently on those matters in which they possess expertise, while observing the submission due to the magisterium of the Church.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 219 All the Christian faithful have the right to be free from any kind of coercion in choosing a state of life.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 220 No one is permitted to harm illegitimately the good reputation which a person possesses nor to injure the right of any person to protect his or her own privacy.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 221<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The Christian faithful can legitimately vindicate and defend the rights which they possess in the Church in the competent ecclesiastical forum according to the norm of law.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. If they are summoned to a trial by a competent authority, the Christian faithful also have the right to be judged according to the prescripts of the law applied with equity.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. The Christian faithful have the right not to be punished with canonical penalties except according to the norm of law.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 222<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The Christian faithful are obliged to assist with the needs of the Church so that the Church has what is necessary for divine worship, for the works of the apostolate and of charity, and for the decent support of ministers.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. They are also obliged to promote social justice and, mindful of the precept of the Lord, to assist the poor from their own resources.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 223<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. In exercising their rights, the Christian faithful, both as individuals and gathered together in associations, must take into account the common good of the Church, the rights of others, and their own duties toward others.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. In view of the common good, ecclesiastical authority can direct the exercise of rights which are proper to the Christian faithful.</p>
  <h4 id="2-1TITLE_II">TITLE II. THE OBLIGATIONS AND RIGHTS OF THE LAY CHRISTIAN FAITHFUL (Cann. 224 - 231)</h4>
  </p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 224 In addition to those obligations and rights which are common to all the Christian faithful and those which are established in other canons, the lay Christian faithful are bound by the obligations and possess the rights which are enumerated in the canons of this title.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 225<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Since, like all the Christian faithful, lay persons are designated by God for the apostolate through baptism and confirmation, they are bound by the general obligation and possess the right as individuals, or joined in associations, to work so that the divine message of salvation is made known and accepted by all persons everywhere in the world. This obligation is even more compelling in those circumstances in which only through them can people hear the gospel and know Christ.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. According to each one’s own condition, they are also bound by a particular duty to imbue and perfect the order of temporal affairs with the spirit of the gospel and thus to give witness to Christ, especially in carrying out these same affairs and in exercising secular functions.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 226<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. According to their own vocation, those who live in the marital state are bound by a special duty to work through marriage and the family to build up the people of God.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Since they have given life to their children, parents have a most grave obligation and possess the right to educate them. Therefore, it is for Christian parents particularly to take care of the Christian education of their children according to the doctrine handed on by the Church.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 227 The lay Christian faithful have the right to have recognized that freedom which all citizens have in the affairs of the earthly city. When using that same freedom, however, they are to take care that their actions are imbued with the spirit of the gospel and are to heed the doctrine set forth by the magisterium of the Church. In matters of opinion, moreover, they are to avoid setting forth their own opinion as the doctrine of the Church.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 228<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Lay persons who are found suitable are qualified to be admitted by the sacred pastors to those ecclesiastical offices and functions which they are able to exercise according to the precepts of the law.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Lay persons who excel in necessary knowledge, prudence, and integrity are qualified to assist the pastors of the Church as experts and advisors, even in councils according to the norm of law.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 229<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Lay persons are bound by the obligation and possess the right to acquire knowledge of Christian doctrine appropriate to the capacity and condition of each in order for them to be able to live according to this doctrine, announce it themselves, defend it if necessary, and take their part in exercising the apostolate.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. They also possess the right to acquire that fuller knowledge of the sacred sciences which are taught in ecclesiastical universities and faculties or in institutes of religious sciences, by attending classes there and pursuing academic degrees.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. If the prescripts regarding the requisite suitability have been observed, they are also qualified to receive from legitimate ecclesiastical authority a mandate to teach the sacred sciences.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 230<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Lay persons who possess the age and qualifications established by decree of the conference of bishops can be admitted on a stable basis through the prescribed liturgical rite to the ministries of lector and acolyte.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless, the conferral of these ministries does not grant them the right to obtain support or remuneration from the Church.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Lay persons can fulfill the function of lector in liturgical actions by temporary designation. All lay persons can also perform the functions of commentator or cantor, or other functions, according to the norm of law.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. When the need of the Church warrants it and ministers are lacking, lay persons, even if they are not lectors or acolytes, can also supply certain of their duties, namely, to exercise the ministry of the word, to preside over liturgical prayers, to confer baptism, and to distribute Holy Communion, according to the prescripts of the law.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 231<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Lay persons who permanently or temporarily devote themselves to special service of the Church are obliged to acquire the appropriate formation required to fulfill their function properly and to carry out this function conscientiously, eagerly, and diligently.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Without prejudice to the prescript of&nbsp;can. 230, §1 and with the prescripts of civil law having been observed, lay persons have the right to decent remuneration appropriate to their condition so that they are able to provide decently for their own needs and those of their family. They also have a right for their social provision, social security, and health benefits to be duly provided.</p>
  <h4 id="2-1TITLE_III">TITLE III. SACRED MINISTERS OR CLERICS (Cann. 232 - 293)</h4>
  <h5 id="2-1-3CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I. THE FORMATION OF CLERICS</h5>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 232 The Church has the duty and the proper and exclusive right to form those who are designated for the sacred ministries.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 233<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The duty of fostering vocations rests with the entire Christian community so that the needs of the sacred ministry in the universal Church are provided for sufficiently. This duty especially binds Christian families, educators, and, in a special way, priests, particularly pastors. Diocesan bishops, who most especially are to be concerned for promoting vocations, are to teach the people entrusted to them of the importance of the sacred ministry and of the need for ministers in the Church and are to encourage and support endeavors to foster vocations, especially by means of projects established for that purpose.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Moreover, priests, and especially diocesan bishops, are to have concern that men of a more mature age who consider themselves called to the sacred ministries are prudently assisted in word and deed and duly prepared.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 234<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Minor seminaries and other similar institutions are to be preserved, where they exist, and fostered; for the sake of fostering vocations, these institutions provide special religious formation together with instruction in the humanities and science. Where the diocesan bishop judges it expedient, he is to erect a minor seminary or similar institution.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Unless in certain cases circumstances indicate otherwise, young men disposed to the priesthood are to be provided with that formation in the humanities and science by which the youth in their own region are prepared to pursue higher studies.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 235<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Young men who intend to enter the priesthood are to be provided with a suitable spiritual formation and prepared for their proper duties in a major seminary throughout the entire time of formation or, if in the judgment of the diocesan bishop circumstances demand it, for at least four years.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The diocesan bishop is to entrust those who legitimately reside outside a seminary to a devout and suitable priest who is to be watchful that they are carefully formed in the spiritual life and in discipline.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 236 According to the prescripts of the conference of bishops, those aspiring to the permanent diaconate are to be formed to nourish a spiritual life and instructed to fulfill correctly the duties proper to that order:</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">1/</span> young men are to live at least three years in some special house unless the diocesan bishop has established otherwise for grave reasons;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">2/</span> men of a more mature age, whether celibate or married, are to spend three years in a program defined by the conference of bishops.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 237<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Where it is possible and expedient, there is to be a major seminary in every diocese; otherwise, the students who are preparing for the sacred ministries are to be entrusted to another seminary, or an interdiocesan seminary is to be erected.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. An interdiocesan seminary is not to be erected unless the conference of bishops, if the seminary is for its entire territory, or the bishops involved have obtained the prior approval of the Apostolic See for both the erection of the seminary and its statutes.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 238<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Seminaries legitimately erected possess juridic personality in the Church by the law itself.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. In the handling of all affairs, the rector of the seminary represents it unless competent authority has established otherwise for certain affairs.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 239<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Every seminary is to have a rector who presides over it, a vice-rector if one is needed, a finance officer, and, if the students pursue their studies in the seminary itself, teachers who give instruction in various disciplines coordinated in an appropriate manner.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Every seminary is to have at least one spiritual director, though the students remain free to approach other priests who have been designated for this function by the bishop.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. The statutes of a seminary are to provide ways through which the other moderators, the teachers, and even the students themselves participate in the responsibility of the rector, especially in maintaining discipline.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 240<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. In addition to ordinary confessors, other confessors are to come regularly to the seminary. Without prejudice to the discipline of the seminary, students are always free to approach any confessor, whether in the seminary or outside it.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. When decisions are made about admitting students to orders or dismissing them from the seminary, the opinion of the spiritual director and confessors can never be sought.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 241<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A diocesan bishop is to admit to a major seminary only those who are judged qualified to dedicate themselves permanently to the sacred ministries; he is to consider their human, moral, spiritual, and intellectual qualities, their physical and psychic health, and their correct intention.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Before they are accepted, they must submit documents of the reception of baptism and confirmation and any other things required by the prescripts of the program of priestly formation.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. If it concerns admitting those who were dismissed from another seminary or religious institute, testimony of the respective superior is also required, especially concerning the cause for their dismissal or departure.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 242<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Each nation is to have a program of priestly formation which is to be established by the conference of bishops, attentive to the norms issued by the supreme authority of the Church, and which is to be approved by the Holy See. This program is to be adapted to new circumstances, also with the approval of the Holy See, and is to define the main principles of the instruction to be given in the seminary and general norms adapted to the pastoral needs of each region or province.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. All seminaries, both diocesan and interdiocesan, are to observe the norms of the program mentioned in §1.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 243 In addition, each seminary is to have its own rule, approved by the diocesan bishop, or, if it is an interdiocesan seminary, by the bishops involved, which is to adapt the norms of the program of priestly formation to particular circumstances and especially to determine more precisely the points of discipline which pertain to the daily life of the students and the order of the entire seminary.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 244 The spiritual formation and doctrinal instruction of the students in a seminary are to be arranged harmoniously and so organized that each student, according to his character, acquires the spirit of the gospel and a close relationship with Christ along with appropriate human maturity.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 245<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Through their spiritual formation, students are to become equipped to exercise the pastoral ministry fruitfully and are to be formed in a missionary spirit; they are to learn that ministry always carried out in living faith and charity fosters their own sanctification. They also are to learn to cultivate those virtues which are valued highly in human relations so that they are able to achieve an appropriate integration between human and supernatural goods.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Students are so to be formed that, imbued with love of the Church of Christ, they are bound by humble and filial charity to the Roman Pontiff, the successor of Peter, are attached to their own bishop as faithful coworkers, and work together with their brothers. Through common life in the seminary and through relationships of friendship and of association cultivated with others, they are to be prepared for fraternal union with the diocesan presbyterium whose partners they will be in the service of the Church.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 246<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The eucharistic celebration is to be the center of the entire life of a seminary in such a way that, sharing in the very love of Christ, the students daily draw strength of spirit for apostolic work and for their spiritual life especially from this richest of sources.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. They are to be formed in the celebration of the liturgy of the hours by which the ministers of God pray to God in the name of the Church for all the people entrusted to them, and indeed, for the whole world.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. The veneration of the Blessed Virgin Mary, including the marian rosary, mental prayer, and other exercises of piety are to be fostered; through these, students are to acquire a spirit of prayer and gain strength in their vocation.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>4. Students are to become accustomed to approach the sacrament of penance frequently; it is also recommended that each have a director of his spiritual life whom he has freely chosen and to whom he can confidently open his conscience.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>5. Each year students are to make a spiritual retreat.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 247<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Students are to be prepared through suitable education to observe the state of celibacy and are to learn to honor it as a special gift of God.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. They are duly to be informed of the duties and burdens which are proper to sacred ministers of the Church; no difficulty of the priestly life is to be omitted.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 248 The doctrinal instruction given is to be directed so that students acquire an extensive and solid learning in the sacred disciplines along with a general culture appropriate to the necessities of place and time, in such way that, grounded in their own faith and nourished thereby, they are able to announce in a suitable way the teaching of the gospel to the people of their own time in a manner adapted to their understanding.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 249 The program of priestly formation is to provide that students not only are carefully taught their native language but also understand Latin well and have a suitable understanding of those foreign languages which seem necessary or useful for their formation or for the exercise of pastoral ministry.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 250 The philosophical and theological studies which are organized in the seminary itself can be pursued either successively or conjointly, in accord with the program of priestly formation. These studies are to encompass at least six full years in such a way that the time dedicated to philosophical disciplines equals two full years and to theological studies four full years.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 251 Philosophical instruction must be grounded in the perennially valid philosophical heritage and also take into account philosophical investigation over the course of time. It is to be taught in such a way that it perfects the human development of the students, sharpens their minds, and makes them better able to pursue theological studies.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 252<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Theological instruction is to be imparted in the light of faith and under the leadership of the magisterium in such a way that the students understand the entire Catholic doctrine grounded in divine revelation, gain nourishment for their own spiritual life, and are able properly to announce and safeguard it in the exercise of the ministry.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Students are to be instructed in sacred scripture with special diligence in such a way that they acquire a comprehensive view of the whole of sacred scripture.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. There are to be classes in dogmatic theology, always grounded in the written word of God together with sacred tradition; through these, students are to learn to penetrate more intimately the mysteries of salvation, especially with St. Thomas as a teacher. There are also to be classes in moral and pastoral theology, canon law, liturgy, ecclesiastical history, and other auxiliary and special disciplines, according to the norm of the prescripts of the program of priestly formation.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 253<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The bishop or bishops concerned are to appoint to the function of teacher in philosophical, theological, and juridic disciplines only those who are outstanding in virtue and have obtained a doctorate or licentiate from a university or faculty recognized by the Holy See.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Care is to be taken that different teachers are appointed to teach sacred scripture, dogmatic theology, moral theology, liturgy, philosophy, canon law, ecclesiastical history, and other disciplines which must be taught according to their proper methodology.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. The authority mentioned in §1 is to remove a teacher who is gravely deficient in his or her function.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 254<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. In giving instruction in their disciplines, teachers are to have a constant concern for the intimate unity and harmony of the entire doctrine of the faith so that students find that they learn one science. For this to be realized more suitably, there is to be someone in the seminary who directs the entire curriculum of studies.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Students are to be instructed in such a way that they also become qualified to examine questions by their own appropriate research and with scientific methodology; therefore, there are to be assignments in which the students learn to pursue certain studies through their own efforts under the direction of the teachers.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 255 Although the entire formation of students in the seminary has a pastoral purpose, strictly pastoral instruction is to be organized through which students learn the principles and skills which, attentive also to the needs of place and time, pertain to the exercise of the ministry of teaching, sanctifying, and governing the people of God.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 256<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Students are to be instructed diligently in those things which in a particular manner pertain to the sacred ministry, especially in catechetical and homiletic skills, in divine worship and particularly the celebration of the sacraments, in relationships with people, even non-Catholics or non-believers, in the administration of a parish, and in the fulfillment of other functions.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Students are to be instructed about the needs of the universal Church in such a way that they have solicitude for the promotion of vocations and for missionary, ecumenical, and other more urgent questions, including social ones.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 257<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The instruction of students is to provide that they have solicitude not only for the particular church in whose service they are to be incardinated but also for the universal Church, and that they show themselves prepared to devote themselves to particular churches which are in grave need.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The diocesan bishop is to take care that clerics intending to move from their own particular church to a particular church of another region are suitably prepared to exercise the sacred ministry there, that is, that they learn the language of the region and understand its institutions, social conditions, usages, and customs.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 258 In order that students also learn the art of exercising the apostolate in practice, during the course of studies and especially during times of vacation they are to be initiated into pastoral practice by means of appropriate activities, determined by judgment of the ordinary, adapted to the age of the students and the conditions of the places, and always under the direction of a skilled priest.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 259<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The diocesan bishop or, for an interdiocesan seminary, the bishops involved are competent to decide those things which pertain to the above-mentioned governance and administration of the seminary.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The diocesan bishop or, for an interdiocesan seminary, the bishops involved are to visit the seminary frequently, to watch over the formation of their own students as well as the philosophical and theological instruction taught in the seminary, and to keep themselves informed about the vocation, character, piety, and progress of the students, especially with a view to the conferral of sacred ordination.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 260 In carrying out their proper functions, all must obey the rector, to whom it belongs to care for the daily supervision of the seminary according to the norm of the program of priestly formation and of the rule of the seminary.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 261<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The rector of a seminary and, under his authority, the moderators and teachers for their part are to take care that the students observe exactly the norms prescribed by the program of priestly formation and by the rule of the seminary.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The rector of a seminary and the director of studies are carefully to provide that the teachers properly perform their function according to the prescripts of the program of priestly formation and of the rule of the seminary.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 262 A seminary is to be exempt from parochial governance. The rector of the seminary or his delegate fulfills the office of pastor for all those who are in the seminary, except for matrimonial matters and without prejudice to the prescript of can. 985.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 263 The diocesan bishop or, for an interdiocesan seminary, the bishops involved in a way determined by them through common counsel must take care that provision is made for the establishment and maintenance of the seminary, the support of the students, the remuneration of the teachers, and the other needs of the seminary.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 264<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. In addition to the offering mentioned in&nbsp;can. 1266, a bishop can impose a tax in the diocese to provide for the needs of the seminary.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. All ecclesiastical juridic persons, even private ones, which have a seat in the diocese are subject to the tax for the seminary unless they are sustained by alms alone or in fact have a college of students or teachers to promote the common good of the Church. A tax of this type must be general, in proportion to the revenues of those who are subject to it, and determined according to the needs of the seminary.</p>
  <h5 id="2-1-3CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II. THE ENROLLMENT, OR INCARDINATION, OF CLERICS</h5>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 265 Every cleric must be incardinated either in a particular church or personal prelature, or in an institute of consecrated life or society endowed with this faculty, in such a way that unattached or transient clerics are not allowed at all.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 266<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Through the reception of the diaconate, a person becomes a cleric and is incardinated in the particular church or personal prelature for whose service he has been advanced.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Through the reception of the diaconate, a perpetually professed religious or a definitively incorporated member of a clerical society of apostolic life is incardinated as a cleric in the same institute or society unless, in the case of societies, the constitutions establish otherwise.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. Through the reception of the diaconate, a member of a secular institute is incardinated in the particular church for whose service he has been advanced unless he is incardinated in the institute itself by virtue of a grant of the Apostolic See.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 267<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. For a cleric already incardinated to be incardinated validly in another particular church, he must obtain from the diocesan bishop a letter of excardination signed by the same bishop and a letter of incardination from the diocesan bishop of the particular church in which he desires to be incardinated signed by that bishop.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Excardination thus granted does not take effect unless incardination in another particular church has been obtained.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 268<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A cleric who has legitimately moved from his own particular church to another is incardinated in the latter particular church by the law itself after Five years if he has made such a desire known in writing both to the diocesan bishop of the host church and to his own diocesan bishop and neither of them has expressed opposition in writing to him within four months of receiving the letter.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Through perpetual or definitive admission into an institute of consecrated life or into a society of apostolic life, a cleric who is incardinated in the same institute or society according to the norm of&nbsp;can. 266, §2 is excardinated from his own particular church.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 269 A diocesan bishop is not to allow the incardination of a cleric unless:</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">1/</span> the necessity or advantage of his own particular church demands it, and without prejudice to the prescripts of the law concerning the decent support of clerics;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">2/</span> he knows by a lawful document that excardination has been granted, and has also obtained from the excardinating bishop, under secrecy if need be, appropriate testimonials concerning the cleric’s life, behavior and studies;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">3/</span> the cleric has declared in writing to the same diocesan bishop that he wishes to be dedicated to the service of the new particular church according to the norm of law.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 270 Excardination can be licitly granted only for just causes such as the advantage of the Church or the good of the cleric himself. It cannot be denied, however, except for evident, grave causes. A cleric who thinks he has been wronged and has found an accepting bishop, however, is permitted to make recourse against the decision.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 271<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Apart from the case of true necessity of his own particular church, a diocesan bishop is not to deny permission to clerics, whom he knows are prepared and considers suitable and who request it, to move to regions laboring under a grave lack of clergy where they will exercise the sacred ministry. He is also to make provision that the rights and duties of these clerics are determined through a written agreement with the diocesan bishop of the place they request.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. A diocesan bishop can grant permission for his clerics to move to another particular church for a predetermined time, which can even be renewed several times. Nevertheless, this is to be done so that these clerics remain incardinated in their own particular church and, when they return to it, possess all the rights which they would have had if they had been dedicated to the sacred ministry there.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. For a just cause the diocesan bishop can recall a cleric who has moved legitimately to another particular church while remaining incardinated in his own church provided that the agreements entered into with the other bishop and natural equity are observed; the diocesan bishop of the other particular church, after having observed these same conditions and for a just cause, likewise can deny the same cleric permission for further residence in his territory.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 272 A diocesan administrator cannot grant excardination or incardination or even permission to move to another particular church unless the episcopal see has been vacant for a year and he has the consent of the college of consultors.</p>
  <h5 id="2-1-3CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III. THE OBLIGATIONS AND RIGHTS OF CLERICS</h5>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 273 Clerics are bound by a special obligation to show reverence and obedience to the Supreme Pontiff and their own ordinary.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 274<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Only clerics can obtain offices for whose exercise the power of orders or the power of ecclesiastical governance is required.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Unless a legitimate impediment excuses them, clerics are bound to undertake and fulfill faithfully a function which their ordinary has entrusted to them.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 275<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Since clerics all work for the same purpose, namely, the building up of the Body of Christ, they are to be united among themselves by a bond of brotherhood and prayer and are to strive for cooperation among themselves according to the prescripts of particular law.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Clerics are to acknowledge and promote the mission which the laity, each for his or her part, exercise in the Church and in the world.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 276<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. In leading their lives, clerics are bound in a special way to pursue holiness since, having been consecrated to God by a new title in the reception of orders, they are dispensers of the mysteries of God in the service of His people.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. In order to be able to pursue this perfection:</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">1/</span> they are first of all to fulfill faithfully and tirelessly the duties of the pastoral ministry;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">2/</span> they are to nourish their spiritual life from the two-fold table of sacred scripture and the Eucharist; therefore, priests are earnestly invited to offer the eucharistic sacrifice daily and deacons to participate in its offering daily;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">3/</span> priests and deacons aspiring to the presbyterate are obliged to carry out the liturgy of the hours daily according to the proper and approved liturgical books; permanent deacons, however, are to carry out the same to the extent defined by the conference of bishops;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">4/</span> they are equally bound to make time for spiritual retreats according to the prescripts of particular law;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">5/</span> they are urged to engage in mental prayer regularly, to approach the sacrament of penance frequently, to honor the Virgin Mother of God with particular veneration, and to use other common and particular means of sanctification.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 277<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Clerics are obliged to observe perfect and perpetual continence for the sake of the kingdom of heaven and therefore are bound to celibacy which is a special gift of God by which sacred ministers can adhere more easily to Christ with an undivided heart and are able to dedicate themselves more freely to the service of God and humanity.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Clerics are to behave with due prudence towards persons whose company can endanger their obligation to observe continence or give rise to scandal among the faithful.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. The diocesan bishop is competent to establish more specific norms concerning this matter and to pass judgment in particular cases concerning the observance of this obligation.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 278<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Secular clerics have the right to associate with others to pursue purposes in keeping with the clerical state.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Secular clerics are to hold in esteem especially those associations which, having statutes recognized by competent authority, foster their holiness in the exercise of the ministry through a suitable and properly approved rule of life and through fraternal assistance and which promote the unity of clerics among themselves and with their own bishop.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. Clerics are to refrain from establishing or participating in associations whose purpose or activity cannot be reconciled with the obligations proper to the clerical state or can prevent the diligent fulfillment of the function entrusted to them by competent ecclesiastical authority.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 279<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Even after ordination to the priesthood, clerics are to pursue sacred studies and are to strive after that solid doctrine founded in sacred scripture, handed on by their predecessors, and commonly accepted by the Church, as set out especially in the documents of councils and of the Roman Pontiffs. They are to avoid profane novelties and pseudo-science.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. According to the prescripts of particular law, priests are to attend pastoral lectures held after priestly ordination and, at times established by the same law, are also to attend other lectures, theological meetings, and conferences which offer them the opportunity to acquire a fuller knowledge of the sacred sciences and pastoral methods.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. They are also to acquire knowledge of other sciences, especially of those which are connected with the sacred sciences, particularly insofar as such knowledge contributes to the exercise of pastoral ministry.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 280 Some practice of common life is highly recommended to clerics; where it exists, it must be preserved as far as possible.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 281<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Since clerics dedicate themselves to ecclesiastical ministry, they deserve remuneration which is consistent with their condition, taking into account the nature of their function and the conditions of places and times, and by which they can provide for the necessities of their life as well as for the equitable payment of those whose services they need.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Provision must also be made so that they possess that social assistance which provides for their needs suitably if they suffer from illness, incapacity, or old age.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. Married deacons who devote themselves completely to ecclesiastical ministry deserve remuneration by which they are able to provide for the support of themselves and their families. Those who receive remuneration by reason of a civil profession which they exercise or have exercised, however, are to take care of the needs of themselves and their families from the income derived from it.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 282<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Clerics are to foster simplicity of life and are to refrain from all things that have a semblance of vanity.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. They are to wish to use for the good of the Church and works of charity those goods which have come to them on the occasion of the exercise of ecclesiastical office and which are left over after provision has been made for their decent support and for the fulfillment of all the duties of their own state.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 283<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Even if clerics do not have a residential office, they nevertheless are not to be absent from their diocese for a notable period of time, to be determined by particular law, without at least the presumed permission of their proper ordinary.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. They are entitled, however, to a fitting and sufficient time of vacation each year as determined by universal or particular law.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 284 Clerics are to wear suitable ecclesiastical garb according to the norms issued by the conference of bishops and according to legitimate local customs.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 285<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Clerics are to refrain completely from all those things which are unbecoming to their state, according to the prescripts of particular law.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Clerics are to avoid those things which, although not unbecoming, are nevertheless foreign to the clerical state.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. Clerics are forbidden to assume public offices which entail a participation in the exercise of civil power.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>4. Without the permission of their ordinary, they are not to take on the management of goods belonging to lay persons or secular offices which entail an obligation of rendering accounts. They are prohibited from giving surety even with their own goods without consultation with their proper ordinary. They also are to refrain from signing promissory notes, namely, those through which they assume an obligation to make payment on demand.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 286 Clerics are prohibited from conducting business or trade personally or through others, for their own advantage or that of others, except with the permission of legitimate ecclesiastical authority.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 287<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Most especially, clerics are always to foster the peace and harmony based on justice which are to be observed among people.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. They are not to have an active part in political parties and in governing labor unions unless, in the judgment of competent ecclesiastical authority, the protection of the rights of the Church or the promotion of the common good requires it.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 288 The prescripts of cann.&nbsp;284,&nbsp;285, §§3 and 4,&nbsp;286, and&nbsp;287, §2 do not bind permanent deacons unless particular law establishes otherwise.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 289<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Since military service is hardly in keeping with the clerical state, clerics and candidates for sacred orders are not to volunteer for military service except with the permission of their ordinary.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Clerics are to use exemptions from exercising functions and public civil offices foreign to the clerical state which laws and agreements or customs grant in their favor unless their proper ordinary has decided otherwise in particular cases.</p>
  <h5 id="2-1-3CHAPTER_IV.">CHAPTER IV. LOSS OF THE CLERICAL STATE</h5>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 290 Once validly received, sacred ordination never becomes invalid. A cleric, nevertheless, loses the clerical state:</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">1/</span> by a judicial sentence or administrative decree, which declares the invalidity of sacred ordination;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">2/</span> by a penalty of dismissal legitimately imposed;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">3/</span> by rescript of the Apostolic See which grants it to deacons only for grave causes and to presbyters only for most grave causes.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 291 Apart from the case mentioned in&nbsp;can. 290, n. 1, loss of the clerical state does not entail a dispensation from the obligation of celibacy, which only the Roman Pontiff grants.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 292 A cleric who loses the clerical state according to the norm of law loses with it the rights proper to the clerical state and is no longer bound by any obligations of the clerical state, without prejudice to the prescript of&nbsp;can. 291. He is prohibited from exercising the power of orders, without prejudice to the prescript of&nbsp;can. 976. By the loss of the clerical state, he is deprived of all offices, functions, and any delegated power.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 293 A cleric who loses the clerical state cannot be enrolled among clerics again except through a rescript of the Apostolic See.</p>
  <h4 id="2-1TITLE_IV">TITLE IV. PERSONAL PRELATURES (Cann. 294 - 297)</h4>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 294 After the conferences of bishops involved have been heard, the Apostolic See can erect personal prelatures, which consist of presbyters and deacons of the secular clergy, to promote a suitable distribution of presbyters or to accomplish particular pastoral or missionary works for various regions or for different social groups.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 295<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The statutes established by the Apostolic See govern a personal prelature, and a prelate presides over it as the proper ordinary; he has the right to erect a national or international seminary and even to incardinate students and promote them to orders under title of service to the prelature.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The prelate must see to both the spiritual formation and decent support of those whom he has promoted under the above-mentioned title.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 296 Lay persons can dedicate themselves to the apostolic works of a personal prelature by agreements entered into with the prelature. The statutes, however, are to determine suitably the manner of this organic cooperation and the principal duties and rights connected to it.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 297 The statutes likewise are to define the relations of the personal prelature with the local ordinaries in whose particular churches the prelature itself exercises or desires to exercise its pastoral or missionary works, with the previous consent of the diocesan bishop.</p>
  <h4 id="2-1TITLE_V">TITLE V. ASSOCIATIONS OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITHFUL (Cann. 298 - 329)</h4>
  <h5 id="COMMON_NORMS">CHAPTER I. COMMON NORMS</h4>
    <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 298<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. In the Church there are associations distinct from institutes of consecrated life and societies of apostolic life; in these associations the Christian faithful, whether clerics, lay persons, or clerics and lay persons together, strive in a common endeavor to foster a more perfect life, to promote public worship or Christian doctrine, or to exercise other works of the apostolate such as initiatives of evangelization, works of piety or charity, and those which animate the temporal order with a Christian spirit.</p>
    <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The Christian faithful are to join especially those associations which competent ecclesiastical authority has erected, praised, or commended.</p>
    <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 299<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. By means of a private agreement made among themselves, the Christian faithful are free to establish associations to pursue the purposes mentioned in&nbsp;can. 298, §1, without prejudice to the prescript of&nbsp;can. 301, §1.</p>
    <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Even if ecclesiastical authority praises or commends them, associations of this type are called private associations.</p>
    <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. No private association of the Christian faithful is recognized in the Church unless competent authority reviews its statutes.</p>
    <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 300 No association is to assume the name Catholic without the consent of competent ecclesiastical authority according to the norm of&nbsp;can. 312.</p>
    <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 301<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. It is for the competent ecclesiastical authority alone to erect associations of the Christian faithful which propose to hand on Christian doctrine in the name of the Church or to promote public worship, or which intend other purposes whose pursuit is of its nature reserved to the same ecclesiastical authority.</p>
    <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Competent ecclesiastical authority, if it has judged it expedient, can also erect associations of the Christian faithful to pursue directly or indirectly other spiritual purposes whose accomplishment has not been sufficiently provided for through the initiatives of private persons.</p>
    <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. Associations of the Christian faithful which are erected by competent ecclesiastical authority are called public associations.</p>
    <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 302 Those associations of the Christian faithful are called clerical which are under the direction of clerics, assume the exercise of sacred orders, and are recognized as such by competent authority.</p>
    <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 303 Associations whose members share in the spirit of some religious institute while in secular life, lead an apostolic life, and strive for Christian perfection under the higher direction of the same institute are called third orders or some other appropriate name.</p>
    <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 304<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. All public or private associations of the Christian faithful, by whatever title or name they are called, are to have their own statutes which define the purpose or social objective of the association, its seat, government, and conditions required for membership and which determine the manner of its acting, attentive, however, to the necessity or advantage of time and place.</p>
    <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. They are to choose a title or name for themselves adapted to the usage of time and place, selected above all with regard to their intended purpose.</p>
    <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 305<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. All associations of the Christian faithful are subject to the vigilance of competent ecclesiastical authority which is to take care that the integrity of faith and morals is preserved in them and is to watch so that abuse does not creep into ecclesiastical discipline. This authority therefore has the duty and right to inspect them according to the norm of law and the statutes. These associations are also subject to the governance of this same authority according to the prescripts of the canons which follow.</p>
    <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Associations of any kind are subject to the vigilance of the Holy See; diocesan associations and other associations to the extent that they work in the diocese are subject to the vigilance of the local ordinary.</p>
    <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 306 In order for a person to possess the rights and privileges of an association and the indulgences and other spiritual favors granted to the same association, it is necessary and sufficient that the person has been validly received into it and has not been legitimately dismissed from it according to the prescripts of law and the proper statutes of the association.</p>
    <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 307<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The reception of members is to be done according to the norm of law and the statutes of each association.</p>
    <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The same person can be enrolled in several associations.</p>

    <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 308 No one legitimately enrolled is to be dismissed from an association except for a just cause according to the norm of law and the statutes.</p>
    <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 309 According to the norm of law and the statutes, legitimately established associations have the right to issue particular norms respecting the association itself, to hold meetings, and to designate moderators, officials, other officers, and administrators of goods.</p>
    <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 310 A private association which has not been established as a juridic person cannot, as such, be a subject of obligations and rights.

    <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 311 Members of institutes of consecrated life who preside over or assist associations in some way united to their institute are to take care that these associations give assistance to the works of the apostolate which already exist in a diocese, especially cooperating, under the direction of the local ordinary, with associations which are ordered to the exercise of the apostolate in the diocese.</p>
    <h5 id="PUBLIC_ASSOCIATIONS_OF_THE_CHRISTIAN_FAITHFUL">CHAPTER II. PUBLIC ASSOCIATIONS OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITHFUL</h5>
    <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 312<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The authority competent to erect public associations is:</p>
    <p><span class="tripleindent">1/</span> the Holy See for universal and international associations;</p>
    <p><span class="tripleindent">2/</span> the conference of bishops in its own territory for national associations, that is, those which from their founding are directed toward activity throughout the whole nation;</p>
    <p><span class="tripleindent">3/</span> the diocesan bishop in his own territory, but not a diocesan administrator, for diocesan associations, except, however, for those associations whose right of erection has been reserved to others by apostolic privilege.</p>
    <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Written consent of the diocesan bishop is required for the valid erection of an association or section of an association in a diocese even if it is done by virtue of apostolic privilege. Nevertheless, the consent given by a diocesan bishop for the erection of a house of a religious institute is also valid for the erection in the same house or church attached to it of an association which is proper to that institute.</p>
    <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 313 Through the same decree by which the competent ecclesiastical authority according to the norm of&nbsp;can. 312 erects it, a public association and even a confederation of public associations is constituted a juridic person and, to the extent it is required, receives a mission for the purposes which it proposes to pursue in the name of the Church.</p>
    <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 314 The statutes of each public association and their revision or change need the approval of the ecclesiastical authority competent to erect the association according to the norm of&nbsp;can. 312, §1.</p>
    <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 315 Public associations are able on their own initiative to undertake endeavors in keeping with their own character. These endeavors are governed according to the norm of the statutes, though under the higher direction of the ecclesiastical authority mentioned in&nbsp;can. 312, §1.</p>
    <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 316<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A person who has publicly rejected the Catholic faith, has defected from ecclesiastical communion, or has been punished by an imposed or declared excommunication cannot be received validly into public associations.</p>
    <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Those enrolled legitimately who fall into the situation mentioned in §1, after being warned, are to be dismissed from the association, with due regard for its statutes and without prejudice to the right of recourse to the ecclesiastical authority mentioned in&nbsp;can. 312, §1.</p>
    <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 317<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Unless the statutes provide otherwise, it is for the ecclesiastical authority mentioned in&nbsp;can. 312, §1 to confirm the moderator of a public association elected by the public association itself, install the one presented, or appoint the moderator in his own right. The same ecclesiastical authority also appoints the chaplain or ecclesiastical assistant, after having heard the major officials of the association, when it is expedient.</p>
    <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The norm stated in §1 is also valid for associations which members of religious institutes erect outside their own churches or houses in virtue of apostolic privilege. In associations which members of religious institutes erect in their own church or house, however, the nomination or confirmation of the moderator and chaplain pertains to the superior of the institute, according to the norm of the statutes.</p>
    <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. In associations which are not clerical, lay persons are able to exercise the function of moderator. A chaplain or ecclesiastical assistant is not to assume that function unless the statutes provide otherwise.</p>
    <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>4. Those who exercise leadership in political parties are not to be moderators in public associations of the Christian faithful which are ordered directly to the exercise of the apostolate.</p>
    <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 318<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. In special circumstances and where grave reasons require it, the ecclesiastical authority mentioned in&nbsp;Can. 312, §1 can designate a trustee who is to direct the association for a time in its name.</p>
    <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The person who appointed or confirmed the moderator of a public association can remove the moderator for a just cause, after the person has heard, however, the moderator and the major officials of the association according to the norm of the statutes. The person who appointed a chaplain can remove him according to the norm of&nbsp;cann. 192-195.</p>
