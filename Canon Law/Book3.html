  </h1>
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">BOOK III. THE TEACHING FUNCTION OF THE CHURCH</h2>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 747<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The Church, to which Christ the Lord has entrusted the deposit of faith so that with the assistance of the Holy Spirit it might protect the revealed truth reverently, examine it more closely, and proclaim and expound it faithfully, has the duty and innate right, independent of any human power whatsoever, to preach the gospel to all peoples, also using the means of social communication proper to it.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. It belongs to the Church always and everywhere to announce moral principles, even about the social order, and to render judgment concerning any human affairs insofar as the fundamental rights of the human person or the salvation of souls requires it.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 748<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. All persons are bound to seek the truth in those things which regard God and his Church and by virtue of divine law are bound by the obligation and possess the right of embracing and observing the truth which they have come to know.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. No one is ever permitted to coerce persons to embrace the Catholic faith against their conscience.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 749<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. By virtue of his office, the Supreme Pontiff possesses infallibility in teaching when as the supreme pastor and teacher of all the Christian faithful, who strengthens his brothers and sisters in the faith, he proclaims by definitive act that a doctrine of faith or morals is to be held.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The college of bishops also possesses infallibility in teaching when the bishops gathered together in an ecumenical council exercise the magisterium as teachers and judges of faith and morals who declare for the universal Church that a doctrine of faith or morals is to be held definitively; or when dispersed throughout the world but preserving the bond of communion among themselves and with the successor of Peter and teaching authentically together with the Roman Pontiff matters of faith or morals, they agree that a particular proposition is to be held definitively.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. No doctrine is understood as defined infallibly unless this is manifestly evident.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 750<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A person must believe with divine and Catholic faith all those things contained in the word of God, written or handed on, that is, in the one deposit of faith entrusted to the Church, and at the same time proposed as divinely revealed either by the solemn magisterium of the Church or by its ordinary and universal magisterium which is manifested by the common adherence of the Christian faithful under the leadership of the sacred magisterium; therefore all are bound to avoid any doctrines whatsoever contrary to them.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Each and every thing which is proposed definitively by the magisterium of the Church concerning the doctrine of faith and morals, that is, each and every thing which is required to safeguard reverently and to expound faithfully the same deposit of faith, is also to be firm-ly embraced and retained; therefore, one who rejects those propositions which are to be held definitively is opposed to the doctrine of the Catholic Church.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 751 Heresy is the obstinate denial or obstinate doubt after the reception of baptism of some truth which is to be believed by divine and Catholic faith; apostasy is the total repudiation of the Christian faith; schism is the refusal of submission to the Supreme Pontiff or of communion with the members of the Church subject to him.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 752 Although not an assent of faith, a religious submission of the intellect and will must be given to a doctrine which the Supreme Pontiff or the college of bishops declares concerning faith or morals when they exercise the authentic magisterium, even if they do not intend to proclaim it by definitive act; therefore, the Christian faithful are to take care to avoid those things which do not agree with it.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 753 Although the bishops who are in communion with the head and members of the college, whether individually or joined together in conferences of bishops or in particular councils, do not possess infallibility in teaching, they are authentic teachers and instructors of the faith for the Christian faithful entrusted to their care; the Christian faithful are bound to adhere with religious submission of mind to the authentic magisterium of their bishops.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 754 All the Christian faithful are obliged to observe the constitutions and decrees which the legitimate authority of the Church issues in order to propose doctrine and to proscribe erroneous opinions, particularly those which the Roman Pontiff or the college of bishops puts forth.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 755<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. It is above all for the entire college of bishops and the Apostolic See to foster and direct among Catholics the ecumenical movement whose purpose is the restoration among all Christians of the unity which the Church is bound to promote by the will of Christ.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. It is likewise for the bishops and, according to the norm of law, the conferences of bishops to promote this same unity and to impart practical norms according to the various needs and opportunities of the circumstances; they are to be attentive to the prescripts issued by the supreme authority of the Church.</p>

  <h4 id="THEMINISTRYOFTHEDIVINE">TITLE I. THE MINISTRY OF THE DIVINE WORD (Cann. 756 - 780)</h4>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 756<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. With respect to the universal Church, the function of proclaiming the gospel has been entrusted principally to the Roman Pontiff and the college of bishops.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. With respect to the particular church entrusted to him, an individual bishop, who is the moderator of the entire ministry of the word within it, exercises that function; sometimes several bishops fulfill this function jointly with respect to different churches at once, according to the norm of law.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 757 It is proper for presbyters, who are co-workers of the bishops, to proclaim the gospel of God; this duty binds especially pastors and others to whom the care of souls is entrusted with respect to the people committed to them. It is also for deacons to serve the people of God in the ministry of the word in communion with the bishop and his presbyterium.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 758 By virtue of their consecration to God, members of institutes of consecrated life give witness to the gospel in a special way and the bishop appropriately calls upon them as a help in proclaiming the gospel.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 759 By virtue of baptism and confirmation, lay members of the Christian faithful are witnesses of the gospel message by word and the example of a Christian life; they can also be called upon to cooperate with the bishop and presbyters in the exercise of the ministry of the word.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 760 The mystery of Christ is to be set forth completely and faithfully in the ministry of the word, which must be based upon sacred scripture, tradition, liturgy, the magisterium, and the life of the Church.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 761 The various means available are to be used to proclaim Christian doctrine: first of all preaching and catechetical instruction, which always hold the principal place, but also the presentation of doctrine in schools, academies, conferences, and meetings of every type and its diffusion through public declarations in the press or in other instruments of social communication by legitimate authority on the occasion of certain events.</p>
  <h5 id="THEPREACHINGOF">CHAPTER I. THE PREACHING OF THE WORD OF GOD</h5>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 762 Sacred ministers, among whose principal duties is the proclamation of the gospel of God to all, are to hold the function of preaching in esteem since the people of God are first brought together by the word of the living God, which it is certainly right to require from the mouth of priests.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 763 Bishops have the right to preach the word of God everywhere, including in churches and oratories of religious institutes of pontifical right, unless the local bishop has expressly forbidden it in particular cases.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 764 Without prejudice to the prescript of can. 765, presbyters and deacons possess the faculty of preaching everywhere; this faculty is to be exercised with at least the presumed consent of the rector of the church, unless the competent ordinary has restricted or taken away the faculty or particular law requires express permission.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 765 Preaching to religious in their churches or oratories requires the permission of the superior competent according to the norm of the constitutions.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 766 Lay persons can be permitted to preach in a church or oratory, if necessity requires it in certain circumstances or it seems advantageous in particular cases, according to the prescripts of the conference of bishops and without prejudice to can. 767, §1.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 767<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Among the forms of preaching, the homily, which is part of the liturgy itself and is reserved to a priest or deacon, is preeminent; in the homily the mysteries of faith and the norms of Christian life are to be explained from the sacred text during the course of the liturgical year.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. A homily must be given at all Masses on Sundays and holy days of obligation which are celebrated with a congregation, and it cannot be omitted except for a grave cause.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. It is strongly recommended that if there is a sufficient congregation, a homily is to be given even at Masses celebrated during the week, especially during the time of Advent and Lent or on the occasion of some feast day or a sorrowful event.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>4. It is for the pastor or rector of a church to take care that these prescripts are observed conscientiously.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 768<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Those who proclaim the divine word are to propose first of all to the Christian faithful those things which one must believe and do for the glory of God and the salvation of humanity.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. They are also to impart to the faithful the doctrine which the magisterium of the Church sets forth concerning the dignity and freedom of the human person, the unity and stability of the family and its duties, the obligations which people have from being joined together in society, and the ordering of temporal affairs according to the plan established by God.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 769 Christian doctrine is to be set forth in a way accommodated to the condition of the listeners and in a manner adapted to the needs of the times.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 770 At certain times according to the prescripts of the diocesan bishop, pastors are to arrange for those types of preaching which are called spiritual exercises and sacred missions or for other forms of preaching adapted to needs.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 771<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Pastors of souls, especially bishops and pastors, are to be concerned that the word of God is also proclaimed to those of the faithful who because of the condition of their life do not have suYcient common and ordinary pastoral care or lack it completely.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. They are also to make provision that the message of the gospel reaches non-believers living in the territory since the care of souls must also extend to them no less than to the faithful.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 772<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. In the exercise of preaching, moreover, all are to observe the norms issued by the diocesan bishop.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. In giving a radio or television talk on Christian doctrine, the prescripts established by the conference of bishops are to be observed.</p>
  <h5 id="CATECHETICALINSTRUCTION">CHAPTER II. CATECHETICAL INSTRUCTION</h5>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 773 It is a proper and grave duty especially of pastors of souls to take care of the catechesis of the Christian people so that the living faith of the faithful becomes manifest and active through doctrinal instruction and the experience of Christian life.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 774<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Under the direction of legitimate ecclesiastical authority, solicitude for catechesis belongs to all members of the Church according to each one’s role.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Parents above others are obliged to form their children by word and example in faith and in the practice of Christian life; sponsors and those who take the place of parents are bound by an equal obligation.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 775<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Having observed the prescripts issued by the Apostolic See, it is for the diocesan bishop to issue norms for catechetics, to make provision that suitable instruments of catechesis are available, even by preparing a catechism if it seems opportune, and to foster and coordinate catechetical endeavors.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. If it seems useful, it is for the conference of bishops to take care that catechisms are issued for its territory, with the previous approval of the Apostolic See.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. The conference of bishops can establish a catechetical office whose primary function is to assist individual dioceses in catechetical matters.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 776 By virtue of his function, a pastor is bound to take care of the catechetical formation of adults, youth, and children, to which purpose he is to use the help of the clerics attached to the parish, of members of institutes of consecrated life and of societies of apostolic life, taking into account the character of each institute, and of lay members of the Christian faithful, especially of catechists. None of these are to refuse to offer their help willingly unless they are legitimately impeded. The pastor is to promote and foster the function of parents in the family catechesis mentioned in can. 774, §2.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 777 Attentive to the norms established by the diocesan bishop, a pastor is to take care in a special way:</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">1/</span> that suitable catechesis is imparted for the celebration of the sacraments;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">2/</span> that through catechetical instruction imparted for an appropriate period of time children are prepared properly for the first reception of the sacraments of penance and the Most Holy Eucharist and for the sacrament of confirmation;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">3/</span> that having received first communion, these children are enriched more fully and deeply through catechetical formation;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">4/</span> that catechetical instruction is given also to those who are physically or mentally impeded, insofar as their condition permits;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">5/</span> that the faith of youth and adults is strengthened, enlightened, and developed through various means and endeavors.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 778 Religious superiors and superiors of societies of apostolic life are to take care that catechetical instruction is imparted diligently in their churches, schools, and other works entrusted to them in any way.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 779 Catechetical instruction is to be given by using all helps, teaching aids, and instruments of social communication which seem more effective so that the faithful, in a manner adapted to their character, capabilities and age, and conditions of life, are able to learn Catholic doctrine more fully and put it into practice more suitably.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 780 Local ordinaries are to take care that catechists are duly prepared to fulfill their function properly, namely, that continuing formation is made available to them, that they understand the doctrine of the Church appropriately, and that they learn in theory and in practice the methods proper to the teaching disciplines.</p>

  <h4 id="THEMISSIONARYACTIVITY">TITLE II. THE MISSIONARY ACTION OF THE CHURCH (Cann. 781 - 792)</h4>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 781 Since the whole Church is by its nature missionary and the work of evangelization must be held as a fundamental duty of the people of God, all the Christian faithful, conscious of their responsibility, are to assume their part in missionary work.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 782<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The Roman Pontiff and the college of bishops have the supreme direction and coordination of endeavors and actions which belong to missionary work and missionary cooperation.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. As sponsors of the universal Church and of all the churches, individual bishops are to have special solicitude for missionary work, especially by initiating, fostering, and sustaining missionary endeavors in their own particular churches.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 783 Since by virtue of their consecration members of institutes of consecrated life dedicate themselves to the service of the Church, they are obliged to engage in missionary action in a special way and in a manner proper to their institute.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 784 Missionaries, that is, those whom competent ecclesiastical authority sends to carry out missionary work, can be chosen from among natives or non-natives, whether secular clerics, members of institutes of consecrated life or of societies of apostolic life, or other lay members of the Christian faithful.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 785<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Catechists are to be used in carrying out missionary work; catechists are lay members of the Christian faithful, duly instructed and outstanding in Christian life, who devote themselves to setting forth the teaching of the gospel and to organizing liturgies and works of charity under the direction of a missionary.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Catechists are to be formed in schools designated for this purpose or, where such schools are lacking, under the direction of missionaries.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 786 The Church accomplishes the specifically missionary action which implants the Church among peoples or groups where it has not yet taken root especially by sending heralds of the gospel until the young churches are established fully, that is, when they are provided with the proper resources and sufficient means to be able to carry out the work of evangelization themselves.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 787<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. By the witness of their life and word, missionaries are to establish a sincere dialogue with those who do not believe in Christ so that, in a manner adapted to their own temperament and culture, avenues are opened enabling them to understand the message of the gospel.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Missionaries are to take care that they teach the truths of faith to those whom they consider prepared to receive the gospel message so that they can be admitted to receive baptism when they freely request it.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 788<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. When the period of the precatechumenate has been completed, those who have made known their intention to embrace faith in Christ are to be admitted to the catechumenate in liturgical ceremonies and their names are to be inscribed in the book designated for this purpose.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Through instruction and the first experience of Christian life, catechumens are to be initiated suitably into the mystery of salvation and introduced into the life of the faith, the liturgy, the charity of the people of God, and the apostolate.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. It is for the conference of bishops to issue statutes which regulate the catechumenate by determining what things must be expected of the catechumens and by defining what prerogatives are to be recognized as theirs.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 789 Neophytes are to be formed through suitable instruction to understand the gospel truth more deeply and to fulfill the duties assumed through baptism; they are to be imbued with a sincere love for Christ and his Church.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 790<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. It is for the diocesan bishop in the territories of a mission:</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">1/</span> to promote, direct, and coordinate endeavors and works which pertain to missionary action;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">2/</span> to take care that appropriate agreements are entered into with moderators of institutes which dedicate themselves to missionary work and that relations with them result in the good of the mission.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. All missionaries, even religious and their assistants living in his jurisdiction, are subject to the prescripts issued by the diocesan bishop mentioned in §1, n. 1.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 791 To foster missionary cooperation in individual dioceses:</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">1/</span> missionary vocations are to be promoted;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">2/</span> a priest is to be designated to promote effectively endeavors for the missions, especially the Pontifical Missionary Works;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">3/</span> an annual day for the missions is to be celebrated;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">4/</span> a suitable offering for the missions is to be contributed each year and sent to the Holy See.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 792 Conferences of bishops are to establish and promote works by which those who come to their territory from mission lands for the sake of work or study are received as brothers and sisters and assisted with adequate pastoral care.</p>

  <h4 id="CATHOLICEDU">TITLE III. CATHOLIC EDUCATION (Cann. 793 - 821)</h4>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 793<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Parents and those who take their place are bound by the obligation and possess the right of educating their offspring. Catholic parents also have the duty and right of choosing those means and institutions through which they can provide more suitably for the Catholic education of their children, according to local circumstances.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Parents also have the right to that assistance, to be furnished by civil society, which they need to secure the Catholic education of their children.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 794<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The duty and right of educating belongs in a special way to the Church, to which has been divinely entrusted the mission of assisting persons so that they are able to reach the fullness of the Christian life.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Pastors of souls have the duty of arranging everything so that all the faithful have a Catholic education.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 795 Since true education must strive for complete formation of the human person that looks to his or her final end as well as to the common good of societies, children and youth are to be nurtured in such a way that they are able to develop their physical, moral, and intellectual talents harmoniously, acquire a more perfect sense of responsibility and right use of freedom, and are formed to participate actively in social life.</p>
  <h5 id="CH1SCHOOLS">CHAPTER I. SCHOOLS</h5>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 796<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Among the means to foster education, the Christian faithful are to hold schools in esteem; schools are the principal assistance to parents in fulfilling the function of education.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Parents must cooperate closely with the teachers of the schools to which they entrust their children to be educated; moreover, teachers in fulfilling their duty are to collaborate very closely with parents, who are to be heard willingly and for whom associations or meetings are to be established and highly esteemed.</p>
  <p>an. 797 Parents must possess a true freedom in choosing schools; therefore, the Christian faithful must be concerned that civil society recognizes this freedom for parents and even supports it with subsidies; distributive justice is to be observed.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 798 Parents are to entrust their children to those schools which provide a Catholic education. If they are unable to do this, they are obliged to take care that suitable Catholic education is provided for their children outside the schools.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 799 The Christian faithful are to strive so that in civil society the laws which regulate the formation of youth also provide for their religious and moral education in the schools themselves, according to the conscience of the parents.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 800<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The Church has the right to establish and direct schools of any discipline, type, and level.</p>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 801 Religious institutes whose proper mission is education, retaining their mission faithfully, are also to strive to devote themselves to Catholic education through their schools, established with the consent of the diocesan bishop.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 802<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. If schools which offer an education imbued with a Christian spirit are not available, it is for the diocesan bishop to take care that they are established.</p>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 804<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The Catholic religious instruction and education which are imparted in any schools whatsoever or are provided through the various instruments of social communication are subject to the authority of the Church. It is for the conference of bishops to issue general norms about this field of action and for the diocesan bishop to regulate and watch over it.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The local ordinary is to be concerned that those who are designated teachers of religious instruction in schools, even in non-Catholic ones, are outstanding in correct doctrine, the witness of a Christian life, and teaching skill.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 805 For his own diocese, the local ordinary has the right to appoint or approve teachers of religion and even to remove them or demand that they be removed if a reason of religion or morals requires it.</p>

The diocesan bishop has the right to watch over and visit the Catholic schools in his territory, even those which members of religious institutes have founded or direct.

  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Directors of Catholic schools are to take care under the watchfulness of the local ordinary that the instruction which is given in them is at least as academically distinguished as that in the other schools of the area.</p>
  <h5 id="CATHOLICUNIV">CHAPTER II. CATHOLIC UNIVERSITIES AND OTHER INSTITUTES OF HIGHER STUDIES</h5>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 807 The Church has the right to erect and direct universities, which contribute to a more profound human culture, the fuller development of the human person, and the fulfillment of the teaching function of the Church.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 808 Even if it is in fact Catholic, no university is to bear the title or name of Catholic university without the consent of competent ecclesiastical authority.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 809 If it is possible and expedient, conferences of bishops are to take care that there are universities or at least faculties suitably spread through their territory, in which the various disciplines are studied and taught, with their academic autonomy preserved and in light of Catholic doctrine.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 810<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The authority competent according to the statutes has the duty to make provision so that teachers are appointed in Catholic universities who besides their scientific and pedagogical qualifications are outstanding in integrity of doctrine and probity of life and that they are removed from their function when they lack these requirements; the manner of proceeding defined in the statutes is to be observed.</p>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 814 The prescripts established for universities apply equally to other institutes of higher learning.</p>
  <h5 id="ECCLESIASTICALUNIV">CHAPTER III. ECCLESIASTICAL UNIVERSITIES AND FACULTIES</h5>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 815 Ecclesiastical universities or faculties, which are to investigate the sacred disciplines or those connected to the sacred and to instruct students scientifically in the same disciplines, are proper to the Church by virtue of its function to announce the revealed truth.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 816<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Ecclesiastical universities and faculties can be established only through erection by the Apostolic See or with its approval; their higher direction also pertains to it.</p>
