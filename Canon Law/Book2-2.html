  <h2>PART II. THE HIERARCHICAL CONSTITUTION OF THE CHURCH</h2>
  <h3>SECTION I. THE SUPREME AUTHORITY OF THE CHURCH (Cann. 330 - 367)</h3>
  <h5 id="PONTIFFANDBISHOPS">CHAPTER I. THE ROMAN PONTIFF AND THE COLLEGE OF BISHOPS</h5>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 330 Just as by the Lord’s decision Saint Peter and the other Apostles constitute one college, so in a like manner the Roman Pontiff, the successor of Peter, and the bishops, the successors of the Apostles, are united among themselves.</p>
  <h6 id="THEROMANPONTIFF">Art. 1. THE ROMAN PONTIFF</h6>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 331 The bishop of the Roman Church, in whom continues the office given by the Lord uniquely to Peter, the first of the Apostles, and to be transmitted to his successors, is the head of the college of bishops, the Vicar of Christ, and the pastor of the universal Church on earth. By virtue of his office he possesses supreme, full, immediate, and universal ordinary power in the Church, which he is always able to exercise freely.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 332<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The Roman Pontiff obtains full and supreme power in the Church by his acceptance of legitimate election together with episcopal consecration. Therefore, a person elected to the supreme pontificate who is marked with episcopal character obtains this power from the moment of acceptance. If the person elected lacks episcopal character, however, he is to be ordained a bishop immediately.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. If it happens that the Roman Pontiff resigns his office, it is required for validity that the resignation is made freely and properly manifested but not that it is accepted by anyone.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 333<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. By virtue of his office, the Roman Pontiff not only possesses power over the universal Church but also obtains the primacy of ordinary power over all particular churches and groups of them. Moreover, this primacy strengthens and protects the proper, ordinary, and immediate power which bishops possess in the particular churches entrusted to their care.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. In fulfilling the office of supreme pastor of the Church, the Roman Pontiff is always joined in communion with the other bishops and with the universal Church. He nevertheless has the right, according to the needs of the Church, to determine the manner, whether personal or collegial, of exercising this office.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. No appeal or recourse is permitted against a sentence or decree of the Roman Pontiff.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 334 Bishops assist the Roman Pontiff in exercising his office. They are able to render him cooperative assistance in various ways, among which is the synod of bishops. The cardinals also assist him, as do other persons and various institutes according to the needs of the times. In his name and by his authority, all these persons and institutes fulfill the function entrusted to them for the good of all the churches, according to the norms defined by law.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 335 When the Roman See is vacant or entirely impeded, nothing is to be altered in the governance of the universal Church; the special laws issued for these circumstances, however, are to be observed.</p>
  <h6 id="THECOLLEGEOFBISHOPS">Art. 2. THE COLLEGE OF BISHOPS</h6>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 336 The college of bishops, whose head is the Supreme Pontiff and whose members are bishops by virtue of sacramental consecration and hierarchical communion with the head and members of the college and in which the apostolic body continues, together with its head and never without this head, is also the subject of supreme and full power over the universal Church.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 337<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The college of bishops exercises power over the universal Church in a solemn manner in an ecumenical council.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. It exercises the same power through the united action of the bishops dispersed in the world, which the Roman Pontiff has publicly declared or freely accepted as such so that it becomes a true collegial act.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. It is for the Roman Pontiff, according to the needs of the Church, to select and promote the ways by which the college of bishops is to exercise its function collegially regarding the universal Church.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 338<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. It is for the Roman Pontiff alone to convoke an ecumenical council, preside over it personally or through others, transfer, suspend, or dissolve a council, and to approve its decrees.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. It is for the Roman Pontiff to determine the matters to be treated in a council and establish the order to be observed in a council. To the questions proposed by the Roman Pontiff, the council fathers can add others which are to be approved by the Roman Pontiff.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 339<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. All the bishops and only the bishops who are members of the college of bishops have the right and duty to take part in an ecumenical council with a deliberative vote.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Moreover, some others who are not bishops can be called to an ecumenical council by the supreme authority of the Church, to whom it belongs to determine their roles in the council.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 340 If the Apostolic See becomes vacant during the celebration of a council, the council is interrupted by the law itself until the new Supreme Pontiff orders it to be continued or dissolves it.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 341<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The decrees of an ecumenical council do not have obligatory force unless they have been approved by the Roman Pontiff together with the council fathers, confirmed by him, and promulgated at his order.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. To have obligatory force, decrees which the college of bishops issues when it places a truly collegial action in another way initiated or freely accepted by the Roman Pontiff need the same confirmation and promulgation.</p>
  <h5 id="THESYNODOFBISHOPS">CHAPTER II. THE SYNOD OF BISHOPS</h5>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 342 The synod of bishops is a group of bishops who have been chosen from different regions of the world and meet together at fixed times to foster closer unity between the Roman Pontiff and bishops, to assist the Roman Pontiff with their counsel in the preservation and growth of faith and morals and in the observance and strengthening of ecclesiastical discipline, and to consider questions pertaining to the activity of the Church in the world.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 343 It is for the synod of bishops to discuss the questions for consideration and express its wishes but not to resolve them or issue decrees about them unless in certain cases the Roman Pontiff has endowed it with deliberative power, in which case he ratifies the decisions of the synod.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 344 The synod of bishops is directly subject to the authority of the Roman Pontiff who:</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">1/</span> convokes a synod as often as it seems opportune to him and designates the place where its sessions are to be held;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">2/</span> radios the election of members who must be elected according to the norm of special law and designates and appoints other members;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">3/</span> determines at an appropriate time before the celebration of a synod the contents of the questions to be treated, according to the norm of special law;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">4/</span> defines the agenda;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">5/</span> presides at the synod personally or through others;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">6/</span> concludes, transfers, suspends, and dissolves the synod.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 345 The synod of bishops can be assembled in a general session, that is, one which treats matters that directly pertain to the good of the universal Church; such a session is either ordinary or extraordinary. It can also be assembled in a special session, namely, one which considers affairs that directly pertain to a determinate region or regions.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 346<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A synod of bishops assembled in an ordinary general session consists of members of whom the greater part are bishops elected for each session by the conferences of bishops according to the method determined by the special law of the synod; others are designated by virtue of the same law; others are appointed directly by the Roman Pontiff; to these are added some members of clerical religious institutes elected according to the norm of the same special law.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. A synod of bishops gathered in an extraordinary general session to treat affairs which require a speedy solution consists of members of whom the greater part are bishops designated by the special law of the synod by reason of the office which they hold; others are appointed directly by the Roman Pontiff; to these are added some members of clerical religious institutes elected according to the norm of the same law.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. A synod of bishops gathered in a special session consists of members especially selected from those regions for which it was called, according to the norm of the special law which governs the synod.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 347<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. When the Roman Pontiff concludes a session of the synod of bishops, the function entrusted in it to the bishops and other members ceases.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. If the Apostolic See becomes vacant after a synod is convoked or during its celebration, the session of the synod and the function entrusted to its members are suspended by the law itself until the new Pontiff has decided to dissolve or continue the session.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 348<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The synod of bishops has a permanent general secretariat presided over by a general secretary who is appointed by the Roman Pontiff and assisted by the council of the secretariat. This council consists of bishops, some of whom are elected by the synod of bishops itself according to the norm of special law while others are appointed by the Roman Pontiff. The function of all these ceases when a new general session begins.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Furthermore, for each session of the synod of bishops one or more special secretaries are constituted who are appointed by the Roman Pontiff and remain in the office entrusted to them only until the session of the synod has been completed.</p>
  <h5 id="NOONEEXPECTSTHE">CHAPTER III. THE CARDINALS OF THE HOLY ROMAN CHURCH</h5>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 349 The cardinals of the Holy Roman Church constitute a special college which provides for the election of the Roman Pontiff according to the norm of special law. The cardinals assist the Roman Pontiff either collegially when they are convoked to deal with questions of major importance, or individually when they help the Roman Pontiff through the various offices they perform, especially in the daily care of the universal Church.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 350<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The college of cardinals is divided into three orders: the episcopal order, to which belong cardinals to whom the Roman Pontiff assigns title of a suburbicarian church and Eastern patriarchs who have been brought into the college of cardinals; the presbyteral order and the diaconal order.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The Roman Pontiff assigns each of the cardinals of the presbyteral or diaconal orders his own title or diaconia in Rome.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. Eastern patriarchs who have been made members of the college of cardinals have their own patriarchal see as a title.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>4. The cardinal dean holds as his title the Diocese of Ostia together with the other church he already has as a title.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>5. Through a choice made in consistory and approved by the Supreme Pontiff and with priority of order and promotion observed, cardinals from the presbyteral order can transfer to another title, and cardinals from the diaconal order to another diaconia and if they have been in the diaconal order for ten full years, even to the presbyteral order.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>6. A cardinal transferring through choice from the diaconal order to the presbyteral order takes precedence over all those cardinal presbyters who were brought into the cardinalate after him.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 351<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The Roman Pontiff freely selects men to be promoted as cardinals, who have been ordained at least into the order of the presbyterate and are especially outstanding in doctrine, morals, piety, and prudence in action; those who are not yet bishops must receive episcopal consecration.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Cardinals are created by a decree of the Roman Pontiff which is made public in the presence of the college of cardinals. From the moment of the announcement they are bound by the duties and possess the rights defined by law.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. When the Roman Pontiff has announced the selection of a person to the dignity of cardinal but reserves the name of the person in pectore, the one promoted is not bound in the meantime by any of the duties of cardinals nor does he possess any of their rights. After the Roman Pontiff has made his name public, however, he is bound by the same duties and possesses the same rights; he possesses the right of precedence, though, from the day of reservation in pectore.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 352<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The dean presides over the college of cardinals; if he is impeded, the assistant dean takes his place.</p>
  <p>Neither the dean nor the assistant dean possesses any power of governance over the other cardinals but is considered as first among equals.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. When the office of dean is vacant, the cardinals who possess title to a suburbicarian church and they alone are to elect one from their own group who is to act as dean of the college; the assistant dean, if he is present, or else the oldest among them, presides at this election. They are to submit the name of the person elected to the Roman Pontiff who is competent to approve him.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. The assistant dean is elected in the same manner as that described in §2, with the dean himself presiding.</p>
  <p>The Roman Pontiff is also competent to approve the election of the assistant dean.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>4. If the dean and assistant dean do not have a domicile in Rome, they are to acquire one there.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 353<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The cardinals especially assist the supreme pastor of the Church through collegial action in consistories in which they are gathered by order of the Roman Pontiff who presides. Consistories are either ordinary or extraordinary.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. For an ordinary consistory, all the cardinals, at least those present in Rome, are called together to be consulted concerning certain grave matters which occur rather frequently or to carry out certain very solemn acts.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. For an extraordinary consistory, which is celebrated when particular needs of the Church or the treatment of more grave affairs suggests it, all the cardinals are called together.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>4. Only the ordinary consistory in which some solemnities are celebrated can be public, that is, when prelates, representatives of civil societies, and others who have been invited to it are admitted in addition to the cardinals.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 354 The cardinals who preside over dicasteries and other permanent institutes of the Roman Curia and Vatican City and who have completed the seventy-fifth year of age are asked to submit their resignation from office to the Roman Pontiff who will see to the matter after considering the circumstances.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 355<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The cardinal dean is competent to ordain as a bishop the one elected as Roman Pontiff if he needs to be ordained; if the dean is impeded, the assistant dean has the same right, and if he is impeded, the oldest cardinal from the episcopal order.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The senior cardinal deacon announces the name of the newly elected Supreme Pontiff to the people; likewise, in the place of the Roman Pontiff, he places the pallium upon metropolitans or hands it over to their proxies.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 356 Cardinals are obliged to cooperate assiduously with the Roman Pontiff; therefore, cardinals who exercise any office in the curia and who are not diocesan bishops are obliged to reside in Rome. Cardinals who have the care of some diocese as the diocesan bishop are to go to Rome whenever the Roman Pontiff calls them.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 357<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The cardinals who have been assigned title to a suburbicarian church or a church in Rome are to promote the good of these dioceses or churches by counsel and patronage after they have taken possession of them.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless, they possess no power of governance over them nor are they to intervene in any way in those matters which pertain to the administration of their goods, their discipline, or the service of the churches.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. In those matters which pertain to their own person, cardinals living outside of Rome and outside their own diocese are exempt from the power of governance of the bishop of the diocese in which they are residing.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 358 A cardinal to whom the Roman Pontiff entrusts the function of representing him in some solemn celebration or among some group of persons as a legates a latere, that is, as his alter ego, as well as one to whom the Roman Pontiff entrusts the fulfillment of a certain pastoral function as his special envoy (<i>missus specialis</i>) has competence only over those things which the Roman Pontiff commits to him.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 359 When the Apostolic See is vacant, the college of cardinals possesses only that power in the Church which is attributed to it in special law.</p>
  <h5 id="THEROMANCURIA">CHAPTER IV. THE ROMAN CURIA</h5>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 360 The Supreme Pontiff usually conducts the affairs of the universal Church through the Roman Curia which performs its function in his name and by his authority for the good and service of the churches. The Roman Curia consists of the Secretariat of State or the Papal Secretariat, the Council for the Public Affairs of the Church, congregations, tribunals, and other institutes; the constitution and competence of all these are defined in special law.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 361 In this Code, the term Apostolic See or Holy See refers not only to the Roman Pontiff but also to the Secretariat of State, the Council for the Public Affairs of the Church, and other institutes of the Roman Curia, unless it is otherwise apparent from the nature of the matter or the context of the words.</p>
  <h5 id="LEGATESOFTHE">CHAPTER V. LEGATES OF THE ROMAN PONTIFF</h5>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 362 The Roman Pontiff has the innate and independent right to appoint, send, transfer, and recall his own legates either to particular churches in various nations or regions or to states and public authorities. The norms of international law are to be observed in what pertains to the mission and recall of legates appointed to states.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 363<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. To the legates of the Roman Pontiff is entrusted the office of representing the Roman Pontiff in a stable manner to particular churches or also to the states and public authorities to which they are sent.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Those who are designated as delegates or observers in a pontifical mission at international councils or at conferences and meetings also represent the Apostolic See.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 364 The principal function of a pontifical legate is daily to make stronger and more effective the bonds of unity which exist between the Apostolic See and particular churches. Therefore, it pertains to the pontifical legate for his own jurisdiction:</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">1/</span> to send information to the Apostolic See concerning the conditions of particular churches and everything that touches the life of the Church and the good of souls;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">2/</span> to assist bishops by action and counsel while leaving intact the exercise of their legitimate power;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">3/</span> to foster close relations with the conference of bishops by offering it assistance in every way;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">4/</span> regarding the nomination of bishops, to transmit or propose to the Apostolic See the names of candidates and to instruct the informational process concerning those to be promoted, according to the norms given by the Apostolic See;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">5/</span> to strive to promote matters which pertain to the peace, progress, and cooperative effort of peoples;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">6/</span> to collaborate with bishops so that suitable relations are fostered between the Catholic Church and other Churches or ecclesial communities, and even non-Christian religions;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">7/</span> in associated action with bishops, to protect those things which pertain to the mission of the Church and the Apostolic See before the leaders of the state;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">8/</span> in addition, to exercise the faculties and to fulfill other mandates which the Apostolic See entrusts to him.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 365<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. It is also the special function of a pontifical legate who at the same time acts as a legate to states according to the norms of international law:</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">1/</span> to promote and foster relations between the Apostolic See and the authorities of the state;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">2/</span> to deal with questions which pertain to relations between Church and state and in a special way to deal with the drafting and implementation of concordats and other agreements of this type.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. In conducting the affairs mentioned in §1, a pontifical legate, as circumstances suggest, is not to neglect to seek the opinion and counsel of the bishops of the ecclesiastical jurisdiction and is to inform them of the course of affairs.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 366 In view of the particular character of the function of a legate:</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">1/</span> the seat of a pontifical legation is exempt from the power of governance of the local ordinary unless it is a question of celebrating marriages;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">2/</span> after he has notified in advance the local ordinaries insofar as possible, a pontifical legate is permitted to perform liturgical celebrations in all churches of his legation, even in pontificals.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 367 The function of a pontifical legate does not cease when the Apostolic See becomes vacant unless the pontifical letter establishes otherwise; it does cease, however, when the mandate has been fulfilled, when the legate has been notified of recall, or when the Roman Pontiff accepts the legate’s resignation.</p>
  <h3 id="SECTION_II._PARTICULAR_CHURCHES_AND_THEIR_GROUPINGS">SECTION II. PARTICULAR CHURCHES AND THEIR GROUPINGS</h3>
  <h4 id="PARTICULARCHURCHESAUTH">TITLE I. PARTICULAR CHURCHES AND THE AUTHORITY ESTABLISHED IN THEM (Cann. 368 - 430)</h4>
  <h5 id="PARTICULARCHURCHESS">CHAPTER I. PARTICULAR CHURCHES</h5>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 368 Particular churches, in which and from which the one and only Catholic Church exists, are first of all dioceses, to which, unless it is otherwise evident, are likened a territorial prelature and territorial abbacy, an apostolic vicariate and an apostolic prefecture, and an apostolic administration erected in a stable manner.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 369 A diocese is a portion of the people of God which is entrusted to a bishop for him to shepherd with the cooperation of the presbyterium, so that, adhering to its pastor and gathered by him in the Holy Spirit through the gospel and the Eucharist, it constitutes a particular church in which the one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church of Christ is truly present and operative.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 370 A territorial prelature or territorial abbacy is a certain portion of the people of God which is defined territorially and whose care, due to special circumstances, is entrusted to some prelate or abbot who governs it as its proper pastor just like a diocesan bishop.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 371<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. An apostolic vicariate or apostolic prefecture is a certain portion of the people of God which has not yet been established as a diocese due to special circumstances and which, to be shepherded, is entrusted to an apostolic vicar or apostolic prefect who governs it in the name of the Supreme Pontiff.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. An apostolic administration is a certain portion of the people of God which is not erected as a diocese by the Supreme Pontiff due to special and particularly grave reasons and whose pastoral care is entrusted to an apostolic administrator who governs it in the name of the Supreme Pontiff.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 372<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. As a rule, a portion of the people of God which constitutes a diocese or other particular church is limited to a definite territory so that it includes all the faithful living in the territory.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Nevertheless, where in the judgment of the supreme authority of the Church it seems advantageous after the conferences of bishops concerned have been heard, particular churches distinguished by the rite of the faithful or some other similar reason can be erected in the same territory.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 373 It is only for the supreme authority to erect particular churches; those legitimately erected possess juridic personality by the law itself.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 374<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Every diocese or other particular church is to be divided into distinct parts or parishes.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. To foster pastoral care through common action, several neighboring parishes can be joined into special groups, such as vicariates forane.</p>
  <h5 id="BISHOPS">CHAPTER II. BISHOPS</h5>
  <h6 id="BISHOPSINGENERAL">Art. 1. BISHOPS IN GENERAL</h6>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 375<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Bishops, who by divine institution succeed to the place of the Apostles through the Holy Spirit who has been given to them, are constituted pastors in the Church, so that they are teachers of doctrine, priests of sacred worship, and ministers of governance.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Through episcopal consecration itself, bishops receive with the function of sanctifying also the functions of teaching and governing; by their nature, however, these can only be exercised in hierarchical communion with the head and members of the college.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 376 Bishops to whom the care of some diocese is entrusted are called diocesan; others are called titular.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 377<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The Supreme Pontiff freely appoints bishops or confirms those legitimately elected.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. At least every three years, bishops of an ecclesiastical province or, where circumstances suggest it, of a conference of bishops, are in common counsel and in secret to compose a list of presbyters, even including members of institutes of consecrated life, who are more suitable for the episcopate. They are to send it to the Apostolic See, without prejudice to the right of each bishop individually to make known to the Apostolic See the names of presbyters whom he considers worthy of and suited to the episcopal function.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. Unless it is legitimately established otherwise, whenever a diocesan or coadjutor bishop must be appointed, as regards what is called the ternus to be proposed to the Apostolic See, the pontifical legate is to seek individually and to communicate to the Apostolic See together with his own opinion the suggestions of the metropolitan and suffragans of the province to which the diocese to be provided for belongs or with which it is joined in some grouping, and the suggestions of the president of the conference of bishops. The pontifical legate, moreover, is to hear some members of the college of consultors and cathedral chapter and, if he judges it expedient, is also to seek individually and in secret the opinion of others from both the secular and non-secular clergy and from laity outstanding in wisdom.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>4. Unless other provision has been legitimately made, a diocesan bishop who judges that an auxiliary should be given to his diocese is to propose to the Apostolic See a list of at least three presbyters more suitable for this office.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>5. In the future, no rights and privileges of election, nomination, presentation, or designation of bishops are granted to civil authorities.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 378<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. In regard to the suitability of a candidate for the episcopacy, it is required that he is:</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">1/</span> outstanding in solid faith, good morals, piety, zeal for souls, wisdom, prudence, and human virtues, and endowed with other qualities which make him suitable to fulfill the office in question;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">2/</span> of good reputation;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">3/</span> at least thirty-Five years old;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">4/</span> ordained to the presbyterate for at least Five years;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">5/</span> in possession of a doctorate or at least a licentiate in sacred scripture, theology, or canon law from an institute of higher studies approved by the Apostolic See, or at least truly expert in the same disciplines.</p>

  <h6 id="DIOCESANBISHOPS">Art. 2. DIOCESAN BISHOPS</h6>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 381<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A diocesan bishop in the diocese entrusted to him has all ordinary, proper, and immediate power which is required for the exercise of his pastoral function except for cases which the law or a decree of the Supreme Pontiff reserves to the supreme authority or to another ecclesiastical authority.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Those who preside over the other communities of the faithful mentioned in&nbsp;<b>⇒</b>&nbsp;can. 368 are equivalent in law to a diocesan bishop unless it is otherwise apparent from the nature of the matter or from a prescript of law.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 382<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. One promoted as bishop cannot assume the exercise of the office entrusted to him before he has taken canonical possession of the diocese. Nevertheless, he is able to exercise offices which he already had in the same diocese at the time of promotion, without prejudice to the prescript of&nbsp;<b>⇒</b>&nbsp;can. 409, §2.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Unless he is prevented by a legitimate impediment, one promoted to the office of diocesan bishop must take canonical possession of his diocese within four months of receipt of the apostolic letter if he has not already been consecrated a bishop; if he has already been consecrated, within two months from receipt of this letter.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. A bishop takes canonical possession of a diocese when he personally or through a proxy has shown the apostolic letter in the same diocese to the college of consultors in the presence of the chancellor of the curia, who records the event. In newly erected dioceses, he takes canonical possession when he has seen to the communication of the same letter to the clergy and people present in the cathedral church, with the senior presbyter among those present recording the event.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>4. It is strongly recommended that the taking of canonical possession be done within a liturgical act in the cathedral church with the clergy and people gathered together.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 383<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. In exercising the function of a pastor, a diocesan bishop is to show himself concerned for all the Christian faithful entrusted to his care, of whatever age, condition, or nationality they are, whether living in the territory or staying there temporarily; he is also to extend an apostolic spirit to those who are not able to make sufficient use of ordinary pastoral care because of the condition of their life and to those who no longer practice their religion.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. If he has faithful of a different rite in his diocese, he is to provide for their spiritual needs either through priests or parishes of the same rite or through an episcopal vicar.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. He is to act with humanity and charity toward the brothers and sisters who are not in full communion with the Catholic Church and is to foster ecumenism as it is understood by the Church.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>4. He is to consider the non-baptized as committed to him in the Lord, so that there shines on them the charity of Christ whose witness a bishop must be before all people.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 384 With special solicitude, a diocesan bishop is to attend to presbyters and listen to them as assistants and counselors. He is to protect their rights and take care that they correctly fulfill the obligations proper to their state and that the means and institutions which they need to foster spiritual and intellectual life are available to them.</p>
  <p>He also is to take care that provision is made for their decent support and social assistance, according to the norm of law.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 385 As much as possible, a diocesan bishop is to foster vocations to different ministries and to consecrated life, with special care shown for priestly and missionary vocations.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 386<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A diocesan bishop, frequently preaching in person, is bound to propose and explain to the faithful the truths of the faith which are to be believed and applied to morals. He is also to take care that the prescripts of the canons on the ministry of the word, especially those on the homily and catechetical instruction, are carefully observed so that the whole Christian doctrine is handed on to all.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Through more suitable means, he is firmly to protect the integrity and unity of the faith to be believed, while nonetheless acknowledging a just freedom in further investigating its truths.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 387 Since the diocesan bishop is mindful of his obligation to show an example of holiness in charity, humility, and simplicity of life, he is to strive to promote in every way the holiness of the Christian faithful according to the proper vocation of each. Since he is the principal dispenser of the mysteries of God, he is to endeavor constantly that the Christian faithful entrusted to his care grow in grace through the celebration of the sacraments and that they understand and live the paschal mystery.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 388<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. After the diocesan bishop has taken possession of the diocese, he must apply a Mass for the people entrusted to him each Sunday and on the other holy days of obligation in his region.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The bishop himself must personally celebrate and apply a Mass for the people on the days mentioned in §1. If he is legitimately impeded from this celebration, however, he is to apply the Masses either on the same days through another or on other days himself.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. A bishop to whom other dioceses besides his own have been entrusted, even under title of administration, satisfies the obligation by applying one Mass for all the people entrusted to him.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>4. A bishop who has not satisfied the obligation mentioned in §§1-3 is to apply as soon as possible as many Masses for the people as he has omitted.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 389 He is frequently to preside at the celebration of the Most Holy Eucharist in the cathedral church or another church of his diocese, especially on holy days of obligation and other solemnities.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 390 A diocesan bishop can perform pontifical functions in his entire diocese but not outside his own diocese without the express, or at least reasonably presumed, consent of the local ordinary.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 391<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. It is for the diocesan bishop to govern the particular church entrusted to him with legislative, executive, and judicial power according to the norm of law.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The bishop exercises legislative power himself. He exercises executive power either personally or through vicars general or episcopal vicars according to the norm of law. He exercises judicial power either personally or through the judicial vicar and judges according to the norm of law.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 392<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Since he must protect the unity of the universal Church, a bishop is bound to promote the common discipline of the whole Church and therefore to urge the observance of all ecclesiastical laws.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. He is to exercise vigilance so that abuses do not creep into ecclesiastical discipline, especially regarding the ministry of the word, the celebration of the sacraments and sacramentals, the worship of God and the veneration of the saints, and the administration of goods.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 393 The diocesan bishop represents his diocese in all its juridic affairs.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 394<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A bishop is to foster various forms of the apostolate in the diocese and is to take care that in the entire diocese or in its particular districts, all the works of the apostolate are coordinated under his direction, with due regard for the proper character of each.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. He is to insist upon the duty which binds the faithful to exercise the apostolate according to each one’s condition and ability and is to exhort them to participate in and assist the various works of the apostolate according to the needs of place and time.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 395<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Even if a diocesan bishop has a coadjutor or auxiliary, he is bound by the law of personal residence in the diocese.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Apart from ad limina visits, councils, synods of bishops, conferences of bishops which he must attend, or some other duty legitimately entrusted to him, he can be absent from his diocese for a reasonable cause but not beyond a month, whether continuous or interrupted, and provided that he makes provision so that the diocese will suffer no detriment from his absence.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. He is not to be absent from the diocese on Christmas, during Holy Week, and on Easter, Pentecost, and the Feast of the Body and Blood of Christ, except for a grave and urgent cause.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>4. If a bishop has been illegitimately absent from the diocese for more than six months, the metropolitan is to inform the Apostolic See of his absence; if it concerns the metropolitan, the senior suffragan is to do so.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 396<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A bishop is obliged to visit the diocese annually either in whole or in part, so that he visits the entire diocese at least every Five years either personally or, if he has been legitimately impeded, through the coadjutor bishop, an auxiliary, vicar general, episcopal vicar, or another presbyter.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. A bishop is permitted to choose the clerics he prefers as companions and assistants on a visitation; any contrary privilege or custom is reprobated.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 397<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Persons, Catholic institutions, and sacred things and places, which are located within the area of the diocese, are subject to ordinary episcopal visitation.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. A bishop can visit members of religious institutes of pontifical right and their houses only in the cases expressed in law.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 398 A bishop is to strive to complete the pastoral visitation with due diligence. He is to take care that he does not burden or impose a hardship on anyone through unnecessary expenses.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 399<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Every Five years a diocesan bishop is bound to make a report to the Supreme Pontiff on the state of the diocese entrusted to him, according to the form and time determined by the Apostolic See.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. If the year determined for submitting a report falls entirely or in part within the first two years of his governance of a diocese, a bishop can refrain from making and submitting his report on this one occasion.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 400<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Unless the Apostolic See has established otherwise, during the year in which he is bound to submit a report to the Supreme Pontiff, a diocesan bishop is to go to Rome to venerate the tombs of the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul and to present himself to the Roman Pontiff.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. A bishop is to satisfy the above-mentioned obligation personally unless he is legitimately impeded. In that case, he is to satisfy it through his coadjutor, if he has one, or auxiliary, or a suitable priest of his presbyterium who resides in his diocese.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. An apostolic vicar can satisfy this obligation through a proxy, even one living in Rome. This obligation does not bind an apostolic prefect.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 401<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A diocesan bishop who has completed the seventy-fifth year of age is requested to present his resignation from office to the Supreme Pontiff, who will make provision after he has examined all the circumstances.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. A diocesan bishop who has become less able to fulfill his office because of ill health or some other grave cause is earnestly requested to present his resignation from office.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 402<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1.

  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The conference of bishops must take care that suitable and decent support is provided for a retired bishop, with attention given to the primary obligation which binds the diocese he has served.</p>
  <h6 id="COADJAUX">Art. 3. COADJUTOR AND AUXILIARY BISHOPS</h6>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 403<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. When the pastoral needs of a diocese suggest it, one or more auxiliary bishops are to be appointed at the request of the diocesan bishop. An auxiliary bishop does not possess the right of succession.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. In more serious circumstances, even of a personal nature, an auxiliary bishop provided with special faculties can be given to a diocesan bishop.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. If it appears more opportune to the Holy See, it can appoint ex officio a coadjutor bishop who also has special faculties. A coadjutor bishop possesses the right of succession.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 404<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A coadjutor bishop takes possession of his office when he, either personally or through a proxy, has shown the apostolic letter of appointment to the diocesan bishop and college of consultors in the presence of the chancellor of the curia, who records the event.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. An auxiliary bishop takes possession of his office when he has shown the apostolic letter of appointment to the diocesan bishop in the presence of the chancellor of the curia, who records the event.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. If the diocesan bishop is completely impeded, however, it suffices that both the coadjutor bishop and the auxiliary bishop show the apostolic letter of appointment to the college of consultors in the presence of the chancellor of the curia.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 405<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A coadjutor bishop and an auxiliary bishop have the obligations and rights which are determined in the prescripts of the following canons and are defined in the letter of their appointment.</p>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 406<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The diocesan bishop is to appoint a coadjutor bishop and the auxiliary bishop mentioned in can. 403, §2 as vicar general. Moreover, the diocesan bishop is to entrust to him before others those things which by law require a special mandate.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Unless the apostolic letter has provided otherwise and without prejudice to the provision of §1, a diocesan bishop is to appoint his auxiliary or auxiliaries as vicars general or at least as episcopal vicars, dependent only on his authority or that of the coadjutor bishop or auxiliary bishop mentioned in can. 403, §2.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 407<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. In order to foster the present and future good of the diocese as much as possible, a diocesan bishop, a coadjutor, and the auxiliary mentioned in can. 403, §2 are to consult one another on matters of major importance.</p>

  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. Since a coadjutor bishop and an auxiliary bishop are called to share in the solicitude of the diocesan bishop, they are to exercise their duties in such a way that they proceed in harmony with him in effort and intention.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 408<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A coadjutor bishop and an auxiliary bishop who are not prevented by a just impediment are obliged to perform pontificals and other functions to which the diocesan bishop is bound whenever the diocesan bishop requires it.</p>

  <h5 id="IMPEDEDANDVACANT">CHAPTER III. THE IMPEDED SEE AND THE VACANT SEE</h5>
  <h6 id="THE_IMPEDED_SEE">Art. 1. THE IMPEDED SEE</h6>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 412 An episcopal see is understood to be impeded if by reason of captivity, banishment, exile, or incapacity a diocesan bishop is clearly prevented from fulfilling his pastoral function in the diocese, so that he is not able to communicate with those in his diocese even by letter.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 413<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. When a see is impeded, the coadjutor bishop, if there is one, has governance of the diocese unless the Holy See has provided otherwise. If there is none or he is impeded, governance passes to an auxiliary bishop, the vicar general, an episcopal vicar, or another priest, following the order of persons established in the list which the diocesan bishop is to draw up as soon as possible after taking possession of the diocese. The list, which must be communicated to the metropolitan, is to be renewed at least every three years and preserved in secret by the chancellor.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. If there is no coadjutor bishop or he is impeded and the list mentioned in §1 is not available, it is for the college of consultors to select a priest to govern the diocese.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. The one who has assumed the governance of a diocese according to the norm of §§1 or 2 is to advise the Holy See as soon as possible of the impeded see and the function he has assumed.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 414 Whoever has been called according to the norm of can. 413 to exercise the pastoral care of a diocese temporarily and only for the period in which the see is impeded is bound by the obligations and possesses the power in the exercise of the pastoral care of the diocese which a diocesan administrator has by law.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 415 If an ecclesiastical penalty prevents a diocesan bishop from exercising his function, the metropolitan or, if there is none or it concerns him, the suffragan senior in promotion, is to have recourse immediately to the Holy See so that it will make provision.</p>
  <h6 id="THE_VACANT_SEE">Art. 2. THE VACANT SEE</h6>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 416 An episcopal see is vacant upon the death of a diocesan bishop, resignation accepted by the Roman Pontiff, transfer, or privation made known to the bishop.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 417 Everything that a vicar general or episcopal vicar does has force until they have received certain notice of the death of the diocesan bishop. Likewise, everything that a diocesan bishop, a vicar general, or an episcopal vicar does has force until they have received certain notice of the above-mentioned pontifical acts.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 418<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Upon certain notice of transfer, a bishop must claim the diocese to which he has been transferred (<i>ad quam</i>) and take canonical possession of it within two months. On the day that he takes possession of the new<i>&nbsp;</i>diocese, however, the diocese from which he has been transferred (<i>a qua</i>) is vacant.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Upon certain notice of transfer until the canonical possession of the new diocese, a transferred bishop in the diocese from which he has been transferred:</p>

If there is no auxiliary bishop, however, it devolves upon the college of consultors unless the Holy See has provided otherwise.</p>
  <p>The one who so assumes governance of the diocese is to convoke without delay the college competent to designate a diocesan administrator.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 420 When the see is vacant in an apostolic vicariate or prefecture, the governance is assumed by the pro-vicar or pro-prefect, appointed only for this purpose by the vicar or prefect immediately after the vicar or prefect has taken possession of the vicariate or prefecture, unless the Holy See has established otherwise.</p>

  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. If a diocesan administrator has not been elected legitimately within the prescribed time for whatever cause, his designation devolves upon the metropolitan, and if the metropolitan church itself is vacant or both the metropolitan and the suffragan churches are vacant, it devolves upon the suffragan bishop senior in promotion.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 422 An auxiliary bishop or, if there is none, the college of consultors is to inform the Apostolic See of the death of a bishop as soon as possible. The one elected as diocesan administrator is to do the same concerning his own election.</p>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 426 When a see is vacant, the person who is to govern the diocese before the designation of a diocesan administrator possesses the power which the law grants to a vicar general.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 427<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A diocesan administrator is bound by the obligations and possesses the power of a diocesan bishop, excluding those matters which are excepted by their nature or by the law itself.</p>

  <h5 id="CONFSOFBISHOPS">CHAPTER IV. CONFERENCES OF BISHOPS</h5>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 447 A conference of bishops, a permanent institution, is a group of bishops of some nation or certain territory who jointly exercise certain pastoral functions for the Christian faithful of their territory in order to promote the greater good which the Church offers to humanity, especially through forms and programs of the apostolate fittingly adapted to the circumstances of time and place, according to the norm of law.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 448<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. As a general rule, a conference of bishops includes those who preside over all the particular churches of the same nation, according to the norm of can. 450.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. If, however, in the judgment of the Apostolic See, having heard the diocesan bishops concerned, the circumstances of persons or things suggest it, a conference of bishops can be erected for a territory of lesser or greater area, so that it only includes either bishops of some particular churches constituted in a certain territory or those who preside over particular churches in different nations. It is for the Apostolic See to establish special norms for each of them.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 449<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. It is only for the supreme authority of the Church to erect, suppress, or alter conferences of bishops, after having heard the bishops concerned.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. A legitimately erected conference of bishops possesses juridic personality by the law itself.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 450<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. To a conference of bishops belong by the law itself all diocesan bishops in the territory, those equivalent to them in law, coadjutor bishops, auxiliary bishops, and other titular bishops who perform in the same territory a special function entrusted to them by the Apostolic See or conference of bishops. Ordinaries of another rite can also be invited though in such a way that they have only a consultative vote unless the statutes of the conference of bishops decree otherwise.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Other titular bishops and the legate of the Roman Pontiff are not by law members of a conference of bishops.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 451 Each conference of bishops is to prepare its own statutes which must be reviewed by the Apostolic See and which are to organize, among other things, the plenary meetings of the conference which are to be held and to provide for a permanent council of bishops, a general secretariat of the conference, and also other offices and commissions which, in the judgment of the conference, more effectively help it to achieve its purpose.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 452<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Each conference of bishops is to elect a president for itself, is to determine who is to perform the function of pro-president when the president is legitimately impeded, and is to designate a general secretary, according to the norm of the statutes.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The president of a conference, and, when he is legitimately impeded, the pro-president, presides not only over the general meetings of the conference of bishops but also over the permanent council.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 453 Plenary meetings of a conference of bishops are to be held at least once each year and, in addition, whenever particular circumstances require it, according to the prescripts of the statutes.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 454<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. By the law itself, diocesan bishops, those who are equivalent to them in law, and coadjutor bishops have a deliberative vote in plenary meetings of a conference of bishops.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Auxiliary bishops and other titular bishops who belong to a conference of bishops have a deliberative or consultative vote according to the prescripts of the statutes of the conference. Nonetheless, only those mentioned in §1 have a deliberative vote in drawing up or changing the statutes.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 455<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A conference of bishops can only issue general decrees in cases where universal law has prescribed it or a special mandate of the Apostolic See has established it either motu proprio or at the request of the conference itself.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The decrees mentioned in §1, in order to be enacted validly in a plenary meeting, must be passed by at least a two thirds vote of the prelates who belong to the conference and possess a deliberative vote. They do not obtain binding force unless they have been legitimately promulgated after having been reviewed by the Apostolic See.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. The conference of bishops itself determines the manner of promulgation and the time when the decrees take effect.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>4. In cases in which neither universal law nor a special mandate of the Apostolic See has granted the power mentioned in §1 to a conference of bishops, the competence of each diocesan bishop remains intact, nor is a conference or its president able to act in the name of all the bishops unless each and every bishop has given consent.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 456 When a plenary meeting of a conference of bishops has ended, the president is to send a report of the acts of the conference and its decrees to the Apostolic See so that the acts are brought to its notice and it can review the decrees if there are any.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 457 It is for the permanent council of bishops to take care that the agenda for a plenary session of a conference is prepared and that decisions made in plenary session are properly executed. It is also for the council to take care of other affairs which are entrusted to it according to the norm of the statutes.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 458 It is for the general secretariat:</p>

  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 466 The only legislator in a diocesan synod is the diocesan bishop; the other members of the synod possess only a consultative vote. Only he signs the synodal declarations and decrees, which can be published by his authority alone.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 467 The diocesan bishop is to communicate the texts of the synodal declarations and decrees to the metropolitan and the conference of bishops.</p>

  <h5 id="DIOCURIA">CHAPTER II. THE DIOCESAN CURIA</h5>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 469 The diocesan curia consists of those institutions and persons which assist the bishop in the governance of the whole diocese, especially in guiding pastoral action, in caring for the administration of the diocese, and in exercising judicial power.</p>

  <h5 id="CHAPTERSOFCANONS">CHAPTER IV. CHAPTERS OF CANONS</h5>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 503 A chapter of canons, whether cathedral or collegial, is a college of priests which performs more solemn liturgical functions in a cathedral or collegial church. In addition, it is for the cathedral chapter to fulfill the functions which the law or the diocesan bishop entrusts to it.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 504 The erection, alteration, or suppression of a cathedral chapter is reserved to the Apostolic See.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 505 Each and every chapter, whether cathedral or collegial, is to have its own statutes, drawn up through a legitimate capitular act and approved by the diocesan bishop. These statutes are neither to be changed nor abrogated except with the approval of the same diocesan bishop.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 506<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The statutes of a chapter are to determine the constitution of the chapter and the number of canons, always without prejudice to the laws of its foundation. They are to define those things which the chapter and individual canons are to do in the performance of divine worship and ministry. They are to determine the meetings in which the affairs of the chapter are handled and establish the conditions required for the validity and liceity of those affairs, without prejudice to the prescripts of universal law.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The statutes are also to define the compensation, whether stable or to be given on the occasion of the performance of some function, and, attentive to the norms issued by the Holy See, the insignia of the canons.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 507<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. One of the canons is to preside over the chapter; other offices are also to be constituted according to the norm of the statutes, after the practice prevailing in the region has been taken into consideration.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Other offices can be entrusted to clerics who do not belong to the chapter; through these offices they assist the canons according to the norm of the statutes.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 508<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. By virtue of office, the canon penitentiary of a cathedral church and of a collegial church has the ordinary faculty, which he cannot delegate to others, of absolving in the sacramental forum outsiders within the diocese and members of the diocese even outside the territory of the diocese from undeclared latae sentential censures not reserved to the Apostolic See.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Where there is no chapter, the diocesan bishop is to appoint a priest to fulfill the same function.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 509<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. After having heard the chapter, it is for the diocesan bishop, but not a diocesan administrator, to confer each and every canonry, both in a cathedral church and in a collegial church; every contrary privilege is revoked.</p>
  <p>It is for the same bishop to confirm the person elected by the chapter to preside over it.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. A diocesan bishop is to confer canonries only upon priests outstanding in doctrine and integrity of life, who have laudably exercised the ministry.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 510<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Parishes are no longer to be joined to a chapter of canons; the diocesan bishop is to separate from a chapter those parishes which are united to it.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. In a church which is at the same time parochial and capitular, a pastor is to be designated, whether chosen from among the members of the chapter or not. This pastor is bound by all the duties and possesses the rights and faculties which are proper to a pastor according to the norm of law.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. It is for the diocesan bishop to establish definite norms which fittingly integrate the pastoral duties of the pastor and the functions proper to the chapter, taking care that the pastor is not a hindrance to capitular functions nor the chapter to parochial functions. The diocesan bishop, who above all is to take care that the pastoral needs of the faithful are aptly provided for, is to resolve conflicts if they occur.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>4. Alms given to a church which is at the same time parochial and capitular are presumed given to the parish unless it is otherwise evident.</p>
  <h5 id="PASTORALCOUNCIL">CHAPTER V. THE PASTORAL COUNCIL</h5>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 511 In every diocese and to the extent that pastoral circumstances suggest it, a pastoral council is to be constituted which under the authority of the bishop investigates, considers, and proposes practical conclusions about those things which pertain to pastoral works in the diocese.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 512<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A pastoral council consists of members of the Christian faithful who are in full communion with the Catholic Church—clerics, members of institutes of consecrated life, and especially laity—who are designated in a manner determined by the diocesan bishop.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The Christian faithful who are designated to a pastoral council are to be selected in such a way that they truly reflect the entire portion of the people of God which constitutes the diocese, with consideration given to the different areas of the diocese, social conditions and professions, and the role which they have in the apostolate whether individually or joined with others.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. No one except members of the Christian faithful outstanding in firm faith, good morals, and prudence is to be designated to a pastoral council.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 513<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A pastoral council is constituted for a period of time according to the prescripts of the statutes which are issued by the bishop.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. When the see is vacant, a pastoral council ceases.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 514<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A pastoral council possesses only a consultative vote. It belongs to the diocesan bishop alone to convoke it according to the needs of the apostolate and to preside over it; it also belongs to him alone to make public what has been done in the council.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The pastoral council is to be convoked at least once a year.</p>
  <h5 id="PARISHESPASTORS">CHAPTER VI. PARISHES, PASTORS, AND PAROCHIAL VICARS</h5>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 515<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A parish is a certain community of the Christian faithful stably constituted in a particular church, whose pastoral care is entrusted to a pastor (<i>parochus</i>) as its proper pastor (<i>pastor</i>) under the authority of the diocesan bishop.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. It is only for the diocesan bishop to erect, suppress, or alter parishes. He is neither to erect, suppress, nor alter notably parishes, unless he has heard the presbyteral council.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. A legitimately erected parish possesses juridic personality by the law itself.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 516<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Unless the law provides otherwise, a quasi-parish is equivalent to a parish; a quasi-parish is a definite community of the Christian faithful in a particular church, entrusted to a priest as its proper pastor but not yet erected as a parish because of particular circumstances.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. When certain communities cannot be erected as parishes or quasi-parishes, the diocesan bishop is to provide for their pastoral care in another way.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 517<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. When circumstances require it, the pastoral care of a parish or of different parishes together can be entrusted to several priests&nbsp;<i>in solidum</i>, with the requirement, however, that in exercising pastoral care one of them must be the moderator, namely, the one who is to direct the joint action and to answer for it to the bishop.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. If, because of a lack of priests, the diocesan bishop has decided that participation in the exercise of the pastoral care of a parish is to be entrusted to a deacon, to another person who is not a priest, or to a community of persons, he is to appoint some priest who, provided with the powers and faculties of a pastor, is to direct the pastoral care.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 518 As a general rule a parish is to be territorial, that is, one which includes all the Christian faithful of a certain territory. When it is expedient, however, personal parishes are to be established determined by reason of the rite, language, or nationality of the Christian faithful of some territory, or even for some other reason.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 519 The pastor (<i>parochus</i>) is the proper pastor (<i>pastor</i>) of the parish entrusted to him, exercising the pastoral care of the community committed to him under the authority of the diocesan bishop in whose ministry of Christ he has been called to share, so that for that same community he carries out the functions of teaching, sanctifying, and governing, also with the cooperation of other presbyters or deacons and with the assistance of lay members of the Christian faithful, according to the norm of law.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 520<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A juridic person is not to be a pastor. With the consent of the competent superior, however, a diocesan bishop, but not a diocesan administrator, can entrust a parish to a clerical religious institute or clerical society of apostolic life, even by erecting it in a church of the institute or society, with the requirement, however, that one presbyter is to be the pastor of the parish or, if the pastoral care is entrusted to several in solidum, the moderator as mentioned in can. 517, §1.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The entrusting of a parish mentioned in §1 can be made either perpetually or for a specific, predetermined time. In either case it is to be made by means of a written agreement between the diocesan bishop and the competent superior of the institute or society, which expressly and accurately defines, among other things, the work to be accomplished, the persons to be assigned to the parish, and the Financial arrangements.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 521<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. To become a pastor validly, one must be in the sacred order of the presbyterate.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Moreover, he is to be outstanding in sound doctrine and integrity of morals and endowed with zeal for souls and other virtues; he is also to possess those qualities which are required by universal or particular law to care for the parish in question.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. For the office of pastor to be conferred on someone, his suitability must be clearly evident by some means determined by the diocesan bishop, even by means of an examination.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 522 A pastor must possess stability and therefore is to be appointed for an indefinite period of time. The diocesan bishop can appoint him only for a specific period if the conference of bishops has permitted this by a decree.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 523 Without prejudice to the prescript of can. 682, §1, the provision of the office of pastor belongs to the diocesan bishop, and indeed by free conferral, unless someone has the right of presentation or election.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 524 A diocesan bishop is to entrust a vacant parish to the one whom he considers suited to fulfill its parochial care, after weighing all the circumstances and without any favoritism. To make a judgment about suitability, he is to hear the vicar forane and conduct appropriate investigations, having heard certain presbyters and lay members of the Christian faithful, if it is warranted.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 525 When a see is vacant or impeded, it belongs to the diocesan administrator or another who governs the diocese temporarily:</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">1/</span> to install or confirm presbyters who have been legitimately presented or elected for a parish;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">2/</span> to appoint pastors if the see has been vacant or impeded for a year.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 526<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A pastor is to have the parochial care of only one parish; nevertheless, because of a lack of priests or other circumstances, the care of several neighboring parishes can be entrusted to the same pastor.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. In the same parish there is to be only one pastor or moderator in accord with the norm of can. 517, §1; any contrary custom is reprobated and any contrary privilege whatsoever is revoked.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 527<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. The person who has been promoted to carry out the pastoral care of a parish obtains this care and is bound to exercise it from the moment of taking possession.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The local ordinary or a priest delegated by him places the pastor in possession; he is to observe the method accepted by particular law or legitimate custom. The same ordinary, however, can dispense from that method for a just cause; in this case, the notification of the dispensation to the parish replaces the taking of possession.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. The local ordinary is to prescribe the time within which possession of a parish must be taken. When this has elapsed without action, he can declare the parish vacant unless there was a just impediment.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 528<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A pastor is obliged to make provision so that the word of God is proclaimed in its entirety to those living in the parish; for this reason, he is to take care that the lay members of the Christian faithful are instructed in the truths of the faith, especially by giving a homily on Sundays and holy days of obligation and by offering catechetical instruction. He is to foster works through which the spirit of the gospel is promoted, even in what pertains to social justice. He is to have particular care for the Catholic education of children and youth. He is to make every effort, even with the collaboration of the Christian faithful, so that the message of the gospel comes also to those who have ceased the practice of their religion or do not profess the true faith.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. The pastor is to see to it that the Most Holy Eucharist is the center of the parish assembly of the faithful.</p>
  <p>He is to work so that the Christian faithful are nourished through the devout celebration of the sacraments and, in a special way, that they frequently approach the sacraments of the Most Holy Eucharist and penance. He is also to endeavor that they are led to practice prayer even as families and take part consciously and actively in the sacred liturgy which, under the authority of the diocesan bishop, the pastor must direct in his own parish and is bound to watch over so that no abuses creep in.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 529<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. In order to fulfill his office diligently, a pastor is to strive to know the faithful entrusted to his care.</p>
  <p>Therefore he is to visit families, sharing especially in the cares, anxieties, and griefs of the faithful, strengthening them in the Lord, and prudently correcting them if they are failing in certain areas. With generous love he is to help the sick, particularly those close to death, by refreshing them solicitously with the sacraments and commending their souls to God; with particular diligence he is to seek out the poor, the afflicted, the lonely, those exiled from their country, and similarly those weighed down by special difficulties. He is to work so that spouses and parents are supported in fulfilling their proper duties and is to foster growth of Christian life in the family.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. A pastor is to recognize and promote the proper part which the lay members of the Christian faithful have in the mission of the Church, by fostering their associations for the purposes of religion. He is to cooperate with his own bishop and the presbyterium of the diocese, also working so that the faithful have concern for parochial communion, consider themselves members of the diocese and of the universal Church, and participate in and sustain efforts to promote this same communion.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 530 The following functions are especially entrusted to a pastor:</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">1/</span> the administration of baptism;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">2/</span> the administration of the sacrament of confirmation to those who are in danger of death, according to the norm of&nbsp; can. 883, n. 3;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">3/</span> the administration of Viaticum and of the anointing of the sick, without prejudice to the prescript of can. 1003, §§2 and 3, and the imparting of the apostolic blessing;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">4/</span> the assistance at marriages and the nuptial blessing;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">5/</span> the performance of funeral rites;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">6/</span> the blessing of the baptismal font at Easter time, the leading of processions outside the church, and solemn blessings outside the church;</p>
  <p><span class="tripleindent">7/</span> the more solemn eucharistic celebration on Sundays and holy days of obligation.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 531 Although another person has performed a certain parochial function, that person is to put the offerings received from the Christian faithful on that occasion in the parochial account, unless in the case of voluntary openings the contrary intention of the donor is certain. The diocesan bishop, after having heard the presbyteral council, is competent to establish prescripts which provide for the allocation of these openings and the remuneration of clerics fulfilling the same function.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 532 In all juridic affairs the pastor represents the parish according to the norm of law. He is to take care that the goods of the parish are administered according to the norm of cann. 1281-1288.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 533<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A pastor is obliged to reside in a rectory near the church. Nevertheless, in particular cases and if there is a just cause, the local ordinary can permit him to reside elsewhere, especially in a house shared by several presbyters, provided that the performance of parochial functions is properly and suitably provided for.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. Unless there is a grave reason to the contrary, a pastor is permitted to be absent from the parish each year for vacation for at most one continuous or interrupted month; those days which the pastor spends once a year in spiritual retreat are not computed in the time of vacation. In order to be absent from the parish for more than a week, however, a pastor is bound to inform the local ordinary.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. It is for the diocesan bishop to establish norms which see to it that during the absence of the pastor, a priest endowed with the necessary faculties provides for the care of the parish.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 534<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. After a pastor has taken possession of his parish, he is obliged to apply a Mass for the people entrusted to him on each Sunday and holy day of obligation in his diocese. If he is legitimately impeded from this celebration, however, he is to apply it on the same days through another or on other days himself.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. A pastor who has the care of several parishes is bound to apply only one Mass for the entire people entrusted to him on the days mentioned in §1.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. A pastor who has not satisfied the obligation mentioned in §§1 and 2 is to apply as soon as possible as many Masses for the people as he has omitted.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 535<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. Each parish is to have parochial registers, that is, those of baptisms, marriages, deaths, and others as prescribed by the conference of bishops or the diocesan bishop. The pastor is to see to it that these registers are accurately inscribed and carefully preserved.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. In the baptismal register are also to be noted confirmation and those things which pertain to the canonical status of the Christian faithful by reason of marriage, without prejudice to the prescript of can. 1133, of adoption, of the reception of sacred orders, of perpetual profession made in a religious institute, and of change of rite. These notations are always to be noted on a baptismal certificate.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. Each parish is to have its own seal. Documents regarding the canonical status of the Christian faithful and all acts which can have juridic importance are to be signed by the pastor or his delegate and sealed with the parochial seal.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>4. In each parish there is to be a storage area, or archive, in which the parochial registers are protected along with letters of bishops and other documents which are to be preserved for reason of necessity or advantage. The pastor is to take care that all of these things, which are to be inspected by the diocesan bishop or his delegate at the time of visitation or at some other opportune time, do not come into the hands of outsiders.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>5. Older parochial registers are also to be carefully protected according to the prescripts of particular law.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 536<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. If the diocesan bishop judges it opportune after he has heard the presbyteral council, a pastoral council is to be established in each parish, over which the pastor presides and in which the Christian faithful, together with those who share in pastoral care by virtue of their office in the parish, assist in fostering pastoral activity.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. A pastoral council possesses a consultative vote only and is governed by the norms established by the diocesan bishop.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 537 In each parish there is to be a finance council which is governed, in addition to universal law, by norms issued by the diocesan bishop and in which the Christian faithful, selected according to these same norms, are to assist the pastor in the administration of the goods of the parish, without prejudice to the prescript of can. 532.</p>
  <p><span class="indent">Can.</span> 538<br><span class="doubleindent"> §</span>1. A pastor ceases from office by removal or transfer carried out by the diocesan bishop according to the norm of law, by resignation made by the pastor himself for a just cause and accepted by the same bishop for validity, and by lapse of time if he had been appointed for a definite period according to the prescripts of particular law mentioned in can. 522.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>2. A pastor who is a member of a religious institute or is incardinated in a society of apostolic life is removed according to the norm of can. 682, §2.</p>
  <p><span class="doubleindent">§</span>3. When a pastor has completed seventy-Five years of age, he is requested to submit his resignation from office to the diocesan bishop who is to decide to accept or defer it after he has considered all the circumstances of the person and place. Attentive to the norms established by the conference of bishops, the diocesan bishop must provide suitable support and housing for a retired pastor.</p>
