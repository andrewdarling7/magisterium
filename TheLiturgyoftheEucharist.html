  <h2>THE LITURGY OF THE EUCHARIST</h2>

  <h3 id="presentationandpreparation">PRESENTATION AND PREPARATION OF THE GIFTS</h3>
  <h6>When all this has been done, the Offertory Chant begins. Meanwhile, the ministers place the corporal, the purificator, the chalice, the pall, and the Missal on the altar.</h6>
  <h6>It is desirable that the faithful express their participation by making an offering, bringing forward bread and wine for the celebration of the Eucharist and perhaps other gifts to relieve the needs of the Church and of the poor.</h6>
  <h6>The Priest, standing at the altar, takes the paten with the bread and holds it slightly raised above the altar with both hands, saying in a low voice: (If, however, the Offertory Chant is not sung, the Priest may speak these words aloud)</h6>
  <p>Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation,<br>for through your goodness we have received<br>the bread we offer you:<br>fruit of the earth and work of human hands,<br>it will become for us the bread of life.</p>
  <h6>Then he places the paten with the bread on the corporal.</h6>
  <h6>The people may acclaim:</h6>
  <p><b>Blessed be God for ever.</b></p>
  <h6>The Deacon, or the Priest, purs wine and a little water into the chalice, saying quietly:</h6>
  <p>By the mystery of this water and wine<br>may we come to share in the divinity of Christ<br>who humbled himself to share in our humanity.</p>
  <h6>The Priest then takes the chalice and holds it slightly raised above the altar with both hands, saying in a low voice: (If however, the Offertory Chant is not sung, the Priest may speak these words aloud)</h6>
  <p>Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation,<br>for through your goodness we have received<br>the wine we offer you:<br>fruit of the vine and work of human hands,<br>it will become our spiritual drink.</p>
  <h6>Then he places the chalice on the corporal.</h6>
  <h6>The People may acclaim:</h6>
  <p><b>Blessed be God for ever.</b></p>
  <h6>After this, the Priest, bowing profoundly, says quietly:</h6>
  <p>With humble spirit and contrite heart<br>may we be accepted by you, O Lord,<br>and may our sacrifice in your sight this day<br>be pleasing to you, Lord God.</p>
  <h6>If appropriate, he also incenses the offerings, the cross, and the altar. A Deacon or other minister then incences the Priest and the people.</h6>
  <h6>Then the Priest, standing at the side of the altar, washes his hands, saying quietly:</h6>
  <p>Wash me, O Lord, from my iniquity<br>and cleanse me from my sin.</p>

  <h3 id="invitationtoprayer">INVITATION TO PRAYER</h3>
  <h6>Standing at the middle of the altar, facing the people, extending and then joining his hands, he says:</h6>
  <p>Pray, brethren <span class="red">(</span>brothers and sisters<span class="red">)</span>,<br>that my sacrifice and yours<br>may be acceptable to God,<br>the almighty Father.</p>
  <h6>The people rise and reply:</h6>
  <p><b>May the Lord accept the sacrifice at your hands<br>for the praise and glory of his name,<br>for our good<br>and the good of all his holy Church.</b></p>

  <h3 id="prayerovertheofferings">PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS</h3>
  <h6>Turn to the <b>Prayer over the Offerings</b> in the Proper of the day. (<a href="ProperofTime.html">Proper of Time</a>) (<a href="ProperofSaints.html">Proper of Saints</a>) (<a href="Commons.html">Commons</a>)</b></h6>
  <h6>Then the Priest, with hands extended, says the Prayer over the Offerings, at the end of which the people acclaim:</h6>
  <p><b>Amen.</b></p>
  <h6>Then the Priest begins the Eucharistic Prayer.</h6>
  <h3 id="prefacedialogue">PREFACE DIALOGUE</h3>
  <h6>Extending his hands, he says:</h6>
  <p>The Lord be with you.</p>
  <p><span class="red">The people reply: </span><b>And with your spirit.</b></p>
  <h6>The Priest, raising his hands, continues:</h6>
  <p>Lift up your hearts.</p>
  <p><span class="red">The people: </span><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We lift them up to the Lord.</b></p>
  <h6>The Priest, with hands extended, adds:</h6>
  <p>Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>
  <p><span class="red">The people: </span><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is right and just.</b></p>

  <h3 id="thepreface">PREFACE</h3>
  <h6>The Priest, with hands extended, continues the Preface. (<a href="Prefaces.html"><b>Prefaces</b></a>)</h6>
  <h3 id="prefaceacclamation">PREFACE ACCLAMATION</h3>
  <h6>At the end of the Preface he joins hands and concludes the Preface with the people, singing or saying aloud:</h6>
  <p><b>Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.<br>Heaven and earth are full of your glory.<br>Hosanna in the highest.<br>Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.<br>Hosanna in the highest.</b></p>
